review
"Had a pleasant stay at Luxor, great customer service, clean room and excellent location.
I do recommend this hotel, this is my third stay and iI have had any issues.
A minor observation, live music a little too loud this last stay. I was on the 14th floor, room 133"
"Our room began to leak into our suite case while we were out so when we arrived back we found all of our belongings every last piece of clothing was soaking wet, the hotel switched us rooms which was a GIVEN and 100% expected the (bare minimum) ! And only provided 75$ as credit for bar and food I would have loved for them to even buy us a clean shirt and shorts or even clean underwear to wear to bed or to wear after we showered that night but no ( we tried to use the credit for clothes but we’re told we could not) instead we had to bag all of our soaking wet clothes in plastic mgm bags that were provided by their bell service and slept in our clothes from the day with hair smelling like casino smoke and cigarettes… as you can imagine I was extremely upset then we were charged an over weight fee of 69.00 at the airport because of the soaking wet clothes !! We were not over weight when we arrived but we sure took 4 pounds of soaking wet clothes back home just a horrible experience worst birthday trip experience keep in mind I showed the hotel front desk staff the video of our suite case full of water and got a yeah whatever reaction so I’m sure this happens often .. if your wondering what the building next to the pyramid is , it’s where they send all the unhappy guest after there rooms has begun to leak !! Such a crappy experience.."
not happy at all the parking was 40 dollars a day and all the restaurants closed at 3 pm the tables to gamble were 20 dollars or more per hand would like more options...nothing really to do at this hotel will not return
"Stayed three nights for a Stay and Play youth soccer tournament. Seemed like an odd choice but anyhow. I would say staying at the Luxor was a classic case of you get what you paid for. We had a room in the pyramid. It was dated, no frills (I never knew renting a mini fridge was a thing), the windows leaked when it rained but on the plus side the beds were comfy and the shower had probably the best water pressure of any hotel I have ever stayed at.  

The food was not bad, either restaurants or food court options, though certainly came with that Vegas premium price. All the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. The hotel is certainly in need of some maintenance and some updating.

If given the choice I would not stay here again but for the price it served its purpose. It’s location is a bit of a hassle if you want to access the main strip but there is the tram to get you near New York New York and then monorail access at the MGM Grand."
Came out with family for a birthday celebration had a great time at luxor great experience fun times on the casino floor and winnings! Will definitely be back here and staying at this resort again for our next trip
Quick staycae with my wife while I work on the strip. Room had easy access to uber pick up. Room was clean and spacious and I love the separate tub & shower. Nice to unwind in the jetted tub after standing for 10 hours. Returning this week
"Paid extra for stay well but could still smell cigarettes despite being on 26th floor and my skin got so dry.  
It got REALLY windy and it shook the windows.  Couldnt' sleep that whole night.  But the other nights were good."
"The room was okay - lacked a microwave or fridge but we dealt with that. All was okay until we returned from a day out (it had started raining out) we came to our room with parts of ceiling falling in and a steady stream of water dripping that soaked the floor, chair and personal items. After being hung up on our first call to the front desk- the next person was more polite but we were offered a bucket and added towels. “Many of our rooms are leaking right now” so - as long as you don’t visit when it rains you may be okay! Poor response to a very wet and inconvenient situation."
"Hotel was OK. We stayed in the pyramid and the room was quite a walk from the lone bank of elevators, no option for stairs.  The housekeepers didn't clean the room unless you were gone by 0900 in the morning. We stopped the maid and asked her to clean the room after 4 nights, and she still didn't come. Price was right but that's about it."
"Luxor is a mediocre property on the strip, located less centrally so you'll have to walk a bit to the other resorts. The staff was friendly, but the rooms were dark and smelled bad. Also limited food options and casino machines. Wouldn't recommend unless you're ok with the bare bones experience"
This was my first time in Vegas and my first time in the Luxor Hotel. It was a very nice experience. The place was very nice and clean. The pillow and bed were very comfortable. There was no issues with noise and I was able to sleep very comfortably. I really enjoyed my stay and added an additonal night. I will definetely come back.
"We had 4 nights comped at the Luxor and after reading all the not so great reviews, we weren't expecting much. Firstly, the elevators in the pyramid are fine. We were on the 27th floor in a Stay Well Queen room. It was clean and tidy and bright-just as the photos showed. The bathroom was big with loads of counter top space and towels. Really impressed and wouldn't hesitate to stay in one of their Stay Well rooms again."
This room had great water pressure. It was a decent room over all. I had trouble with my digital key not working in the elevators because I lost wifi signal when entering the elevator hallway. I had to stand in line a few time for keys. Two of the three front desk staff I interacted with were a bit crabby. Overall the stay was decent.
"Mobile check in is super convenient but still get key cards as the digital key doesn't always work for the elevator or the room.
Shower door handle was broken.  Bathroom exhaust fan wasn't working.  Counterrtop below TV was sticky and had crumbs on it."
"A truck backed below are room at 5:30 am was there for 2 hours
Doing something with a loud pump running, drinks and food to expensive, had room service food was cold by the time we received it, will not stay again"
"Staff and experience was very nice! Friendly and helpful during our entire stay. I felt very comfortable and safe. The staff was professional, friendly and most of all they seem to remember guest are there to have fun. They had a since of humor which made our group’s experience more enjoyable."
"We came in Oct. 2022 and then in Feb. 2023 to celebrate our Annivesary, our Birthdays and my wife's retirement. This was my wife's 9th trip and my 4th to Vegas, we have stayed at the Luxor the 4 times I have come with my wife, her and her sister and their girlfriends have stayed at other hotels as well."
"Carpet coming off the floor. They charge random prices for shows. Way to expensive for a dirty room and they do not care if you're with a wedding party, you won't be in the same area nor can you get to other rooms"
"I always have a great time at the Luxor, from the tower suites to The Public House. I am not a big fan of the pyramid rooms, but don’t normally have a problem getting a tower suite. Keep up the great work, I hate hearing rumors of the demise of the Luxor.."
Stayed here for a volleyball tournament as it was right next door of where the tournament was. I did not think the walk was bad at all and actually never had to go outside where it was a little cold. The rooms do need to be updated. We stayed in the pyramid part. Room rate was great but where they get you is the resort fees/per day.
"Hotel is nice. But the room was dirty. The shower would flood and the lights would flicker. The bed was also dirty with hairs and it was old, so it wasn’t the best sleep. I was also offered an upgrade beforehand, but the room wasn’t ready. So I got the regular room. But they had a problem taking off the upgrade fee. So I was over charged for my stay. They kept saying they would fix it, but I haven’t seen that happen yet. Pretty disappointing"
Please I am begging you to train your call center people not to lie about there not being a security deposit on a comped room i should not have to come out of no money to pay for my free dang on room is not fair
"So disappointed! I had high hopes for this budget hotel. Expectations were met only for room cleanliness and location. That’s it. Is currently only in the 40’s in Vegas and the AC unit is only spitting out cold air, despite me setting it to the max 80. Contacted guest services last night who said they’d send someone up. I guess I should’ve asked when because no one came. So I slept in my socks, and sweats. Then looked forward to a nice hot shower, but nope. At the hottest seeing the best I got was a smidge under lukewarm, so not devastatingly cold but not in any way comfortable (and zero steam, I love my steamy showers). The hallways are dingy, dirty. I used mobile checkin, so that was easy and decent.
But I can’t deal with uncomfortable room temps and cold showers (and a maintenance staff so limited no one can get to my room in a timely manner) so this is my first and last stay at Luxor."
"I have stayed here almost every year except for the Covid era.  This year the staff was exceptional, the room very clean and maid service each day, and all at a fair price over President's day weekend."
Staying at the Luxor was an awesome experience I always enjoy the rooms the views where to look very good quick to get to the Uber and ride share area. I had good luck in the casino area this time actually left with more money on my gambling budget than when I started! I got to enjoy the Luxor Buffet which I hadn't gotten to try before so I was very excited about that and it was great with great choices and drink options!
"My son loves nostalgic themed Vegas and the Luxor is our favorite place to stay.  The staff was excellent and the room great.  Luxor may not be the newest but it’s our second home and always will be.

We were upgraded to a higher floor room in the pyramid as my son loves the architecture and nostalgia.  The front desk staff were very hospitable at any requests we had and made the trip special.  The room was great and seemed recently remodeled.  Awesome strip view, and within walking distance to all the shows we wanted to see.  

Can’t wait to visit again as he’s already making plans for us to go back."
I stayed as I received discount as part of a conference. I had read reports that the Luxor is possibly going to be demolished. It does feel this way as we noticed a lot of signs of disrepair and no maintenance. You are better to spend your money elsewhere.
The lecture hotel and casino is always a great experience they got great food great staff very friendly lots of things to do lots of things to see staff was very friendly housekeeping was great it's always a pleasure to work with Kyle and Frank
Great room - room suite was more than we needed - enjoyed the quiet - staff really great - very clean - pyramid cafe great for breakfast- husband and I shared the breakfast classic - large portions - enjoy
"The overall experience was not pleasant, from the cold hotel, bad smoke and lack of air circulation. to the high price for cold not good food. Paying $19. at Johnny Rocket for a cheeseburger and fries is crazy. They were cold and when I complained they wouldn't do anything."
"I was a bit apprehensive after looking up reviews a day before flying in. However, I didn’t experience any of the negatives in previous reviews. My room, for the most part was clean, however, slightly dated, which I expected. The location was very easy to get over to Mandalay Bay Restaurants during the day there’s numerous options. However, the layout is a bit weird. At night the food selection is one restaurant, but the food was very good.  It’s very close to Mandalay Bay which offers more premier dining options. For my trip the slot machines payed better than a previous trip to mandalay bay.  The elevator works, but is very slow at times. The only real problem I had was the app for mobile check-in stopped working, and I had to go to the front desk to get a key card. Every staff member I worked with was very friendly, helpful, and it seems like a very positive work environment."
"The hotel is dark, musty and dated. Reminds me of a run down Reno dive. Elevators are slow and can be far from your room. Prepare for a lot of walking. For whatever reason, the Pyramid hotel has almost no Egyptian decor, it's all been removed. There really is no unifying theme, it's like they just didn't bother. The larger restaurants close at 2 so there are lines to eat mediocre, overpriced food. The exception was the Public House, which was very good. The room itself was fine, pretty standard, but since they all face the open inside of the pyramid, the sound from the casino can get loud."
"Hotel was very nice for the price. Very spacious, great view and also had a very nice bathroom with a large bathtub. Very affordable place to stay for what is included when not booking room at peak time."
Very poor experience with mobile check in. Wasted my 5 hours. My guest kept waiting outside. I had to call three times to fix a little problem. Why Offer mobile check in if this can not be honored. My app showed checked in and said.. you will receive an email/message  with digital key. It never came in until I called with my frustration.
"Our room was dirty and broken. There was rotting food in our mini fridge, stained bed sheets, no working ceiling fans, smelled of smoke, broken dresser, everything was just old, smelly, dirty, and broken. I will not stay here again unless the property is updated and it becomes less expensive."
I liked the room. Bathroom was nice with a good shower and tub. Beds were too firm for me but pillows were comfortable. The air conditioner could’ve been better. Maids cleaned very well! Would stay again
"I had heard mixed reviews about the Luxor. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the rooms had been upgraded. There are, like most things, some imperfections (the walk from the elevators to my room was more of a hike) and the elevators themselves could stand to be renovated. All things considered, it was an affordable place to stay for the conference we were attending."
No a bad stay the hotel is a little older but the did remodel the rooms so it not bad and the cost is ok . They do a good job of trying to stay current. its close to the actives that we needed and that all that mattered to us.
Room was clean but no frills and dimly lit bathroom. Hallways very noisy.  Mattress and pillows uncomfortable.  We paid extra for check-in at 11 but were not allowed in the room until after 12.  Price was reasonable.
A hard bed and no in room amenities what so ever. Get ready to spend five dollars for a banana or $10 for a bottle of water. And there are literally no options of food for someone who does not eat meat.
Luxor is a nice Hotel.  Friendly Staff. Prime location on the strip.  They have some things they need to work on like better room service hours and game variety.  Public House is an awesome place to eat.  Recommend you give Luxor at try and give them feedback on your experience to get their entertainment level to superb.
"The got me with $25 a night. Then when you check in there are resort fees of $35 per night, resort taxes of $15 per night, then parking $18 a night. I asked what are my parking options; either $18 for self parking or $35 for vallet. So basically scammed me there too. They took out the mini fridge and left a sign saying you can pay to rent one…. Room barely had hot water. I was still cold while taking a shower. Super uncomfortable. Went to go get a pizza slice. Ended up paying about $35 for some reheated nasty pizza. Overall feel scammed."
Rooms did not have enough amenities. The customer service was poor during check in. Customer service overall was lacking. I struggled to find someone to provide assistance or direction when needed. I will not be staying here again.
Luxor was a good casino. In my room I found blood on the sheets. The location is close to the end of the strip and was food for walking around. If you use self park be mindful of the tunnel and stairs into the casino at night.
Luxor is my favorite place to stay.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Suites are very large and luxurious.  Fine dining at Tenders is always tastey and exceptional.  Backstage Deli is the best I have ever been at.  Love Pyramid cafe for breakfast and Pubic House for late night drinks and snacks.  Just really enjoy this resort and casino
"We had a very nice time at the Luxor. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the view  was nice. There are many restaurants and stores to choose from,the buffet has an excellent selection with a many different options . There is a bus stop right out front."
"My son and I stayed here and it was a very nice hotel. Great lobby, and right on the Las Vegas Strip.  The staff was friendly and we enjoyed a number of the restaurants in the hotel.  The rooms were very nice but a little outdated."
We were here for a conference that was held in Mandalay Bay. Being able to park once and just walk made it worth it. The rate we got through the conf.($58/night) was GREAT but I would not stay here at regular price. Rooms were dated- no usb charging ports- so bring your wall charger. Beds were mediocre but the shower was AMAZING!!!!!!!! Where our room was situated- The speakers for the PA music was so loud it was like being next door to bad neighbors blaring their music. No separate hotel vs casino area due to the hotel design. I know others that have stayed here so maybe we just were unlucky with our room. (Don't stay in #3009 or nearby lol).
"Stayed at Luxor for 2nd time..learning to get around..found indoor walkway to Excalibur + Mandalay Bay..Also rode the Tram between hotels, but wasn't running when windy..lots of signage to find your way around  Casino..fun slot machines..free drinks good ..had fun..
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."
"Would never recommend this hotel. Felt dirty, it’s a structural mess with windows that allow wind to howl in. The staff was friendly but that doesn’t make up for the room quality.  The elevators rarely worked, and if they did you had to wonder if they were even safe."
"This was my third time staying at Luxor hotel. Although the overall experience was very good, the quality of the room that I stayed in was not as good as previous times. The staff was very pleasant and professional. The premises were very clean and were very picturesque. However, the room I was staying in. Did not have a dresser for my clothes."
"Hotel has everything in one location. But, the pyramid cafe restaurant customer service was aweful. Loved view of the mountain front 17th floor east tower. Housekeeping was quick to resolve any issues with cleanliness of room. Beware of people in lobby giving free vouchers you have to listen to a session about another MGM property."
Suite was nice and clean. Bathroom was huge. Casino has great games. Buffet was a good value. Food Court is expensive compared to others. Back Stage Deli was fast and opened late. The Public House was very good.Service was very good. Food portions are big.
"Great property, location, gaming floor, dining options, etc and clean. The biggest problem was housekeeping (or lack thereof). Too many hotels are still using COVID as an excuse to cut back on housekeeping or make it opt-in. In our four night stay, we had housekeeping services ONCE, when we called to complain on day 3. On day 4 we asked them to come again at 5:30 after going out for the night. They never did."
"Good food I was able to order late night & it was very fast service. Hotel is close to everything shops, food, we tried the ice bar & it was awesome. The staff was very nice  & the drinks were great. Will definitely stay here again"
The hotel itself is beautiful. There are lots of entertainment options on site.  My room is what left a bad taste in my mouth from this experience. My room was not clean. Used items were left in the room from the previous guest. Per day parking is an additional fee on top of the resort fee. This was not diclosed previouse to my checking in.
"Although the staff was great, the rooms need attention. The rooms are outdated and worn. There are not any USB chargers in the room. Diablos is worth the stop. It was so good, we ate there twice. This was my 10th trip to Vegas. The food and staff is fantastic, even better than the Hilton Resorts World. But I paid for an upgrade to a queen corner suite. Save your money."
"The hotel is nice, the rooms were very clean, the bed was wonderful.
The TV did not carry many popular stations. The Buffet closed at 3:00. I can't imagine why, The Tender Steakhouse either closed early, or was not open for the majority of my stay. Very disappointing."
"We stayed here 3 nights in the pyramid - the King Suite with a tub by the window looking directly at Mandalay Bay. I always wanted to stay in the pyramid so we finally did! The ""inclinators"" were slow, but nothing more than 5 minutes from the 19th floor. It was a slow time though so I can see how they would get super busy. Unfortunately, our room, 19001 was directly across from our floor's elevator so we had a dang trek every time we wanted to go somewhere or put something back in the room ""real quick"". That's my main complaint - had we been on a lower floor or closer to the elevator - it might not be terrible. Our AC went out for one night, that sucked, we didn't get offered a discount or anything either. But they fixed it the next day and the rest of the stay was fine. We used the food court a couple times, ate at Diablo's, and a few visits ago we saw Carrot Top which was actually really enjoyable! Overall, I don't think we'll be back to stay here."
"Stayed here because of a sports convention. Front desk personnel were rude and unwelcoming, Room was dirty, restroom was not clean, bed was very uncomfortable and sunken in the middle, elevators were old and inside was falling apart. For what I paid, should’ve at least been a 4 1/2 to 5 star hotel. Very disappointed!"
Customer service was poor. They downgraded our rooms and only deducted the resort fee. Our rooms were booked six months prior. We will not be returning to the Luxor. We were tending for a convention and vacation.
"A very memorable experience for me and my husband for our first trip to. Vegas! We truly enjoyed every moment, the only thing we wished we had was a microwave, as food was kinda spendy we were able to reheat any of our left overs."
"This I have to admit was the worse trip to Vegas. Hotel was horrible! If we wanted a refrigerator in our room we had to rent one! On top of that it was $40/day to park our car at the hotel!!! When we stayed at the Stratosphere parking was free and we had a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker in our room. Not at the Luxor!!! Only booked there because I could walk to Mandalay Bay for the conference and supposedly the rooms were discounted, which I don't think they were."
"Decent place to stay if you are attending a conference at Mandalay Bay. If you drive they charge for parking even if staying at the hotel. Recommend getting a key card instead of using mobile app, the app wouldn’t load most of the time."
The hotel feels very dated and dirty. The standard of the rooms are below what I would expect and definitely below the standard of the neighboring Delano and Mandalay Bay. There was no coffee maker in the room and there was no accessible room service to the pyramid portion of the hotel. The curtains had to be kept closed as the sun heated the room beyond the capability of the AC. There were exposed wires and broken buttons in the elevators.
"The person who did my reception to check in did not give me good service and gave me a room that was dirty and the water was not working, I went back to the reception and they changed my room and that one was clean and the water was working"
The price and value for this hotel is great. It's at the south end of the strip so you have to walk a little bit to get to a lot of other attractions. But overall it's a good bargain. The rooms aren't anything spectacular. They don't come with a fridge or microwave. Only major issue I had was the price of the food court is kind of high for the quality of the food. The building is a little smoky too. But we had a great time regardless. Just be prepared to walk to the nearest monorail stop.
Great price per rooms. Our rooms have always been very clean. Great walking distance to a lot of great activities. Great food options within the lobby or very close by. Parking is very reasonable and with plenty of parking.
"There is easy access to the Excaliber, Mandalay Bay and New York, New York. The rooms in the east tower are very nice. Avoid rooms in main building too dark for me, just felt old and kind of dingy. Excellent customer service."
"Our room had no mini fridge, no microwave, and no clock. It's nice, but very basic. I don't even think the WiFi is free because it wasn't advertised like most other hotels are. The tram to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is nice. My room key didn't work when exiting the parking structure the the 4 days I was there despite telling the person at the front desk twice and getting new room keys. We stayed here only bc my daughter had a volleyball tournament and we had to stay with the team. It's close to the Convention Center which is convenient. The elevator travels sideways and it gave me vertigo every time.
t"
"Entire hotel reeked of pot. The guests in the wrong next to us smoked pot the 3 nights they were there. Front Desk and Security did nothing to stop them. If you want to get a contact high at a rundown dirty hotel, this is the one for you."
"The room will not get cold or stay cold (stayed in both the tower and the pyramid, same problem) towels are more like exfoliating loofas than towels, no refrigerator, microwave or coffee pot (but you’ll pay a hefty resort fee) phone in room doesn’t work so you can’t call housekeeping (phone is part of why they charge resort fee) wifi is terrible. The charge their guest for parking. Bed are ok, definitely not meant for a long stay."
"Outside of resort fees and other fees , nice accommodations and staff availability great .Just no reason for fees when staying  off season  Nov thru March and very little ability to use any of the amenities the fees are being charged for"
Luxor is a beautiful building with beautiful rooms.  Elevator was a bit confusing but once figured out it was a nice security feature. Had a few things happen but nothing I would complain about.  I would return to visit again.  Not an avid traveler so not bad after recovering from covid lulls.
"Easy check in, clean and tidy room. Staff was friendly and courteous. Lobby area was neat. Elevator was quick and not overcrowded.  Bathroom water pressure was terrific and my girlfriend especially liked that the room had a bathtub. Would definitely book again"
Rooms are super old and bathrooms are what you would expect from a hourly rate hotel. Shower and shower pressure not satisfactory at all. Even the Americas Got Talent sign on the side of the Luxor is torn up and faded.
"This property needs renovation.  Old carpet, walls need painting, rooms need updating.  No refrigerator in room.  Elevators extremely rickety and painfully slow.  Casino was blah and boring.  The only good thing was that  shower had great pressure."
"I arrived very late to the hotel. I was able to check in using the app and gave me access to the key immediately. I went straight to my room without falling in line.  Using the app to check in/ check out and use digital key was great, quick, very convenient, avoided long lines, and the wait time. Through the app I was able to get a summary of my stay and expenses as well.  Looking forward to using it again during my next stay."
"Stay was overall great. The issues I had were minor: low tissue and toilet paper at arrival.  Toilet flush/water flow is not good - poor toilet design.  No USB outlets. No refrigerator.  Dined at Tender Steak and the hostess was not attentive or friendly - it was as if we were bothering their conversation.  Service at the Tender and pyramid cafe was slow (initially - after being seated, too a long time to get drink orders and bread)."
"This 29 year old hotel shows in every corner from top to bottom. If you're looking a basic place than perhaps this is it, but between wonky elevators and strange rooms, this is not the place for my family. Staff is nice enough and their pillows were comfortable, but between the parking, shower shutting off and outlets not working it is not worth trouble when there are so many other properties to select in Vegas. We unfortunately were mandated to stay here for a team sporting event. I will never stay here again."
Went for the volleyball tournament held at Mandalay Bay. We like the fact the Luxor is close enough to walk! Looking forward to seeing what the renovations are going to be in their pool area. Wish there was a refrigerator in the room.
Great price. Have to pay for parking. Worn furniture. No room service really. Walkway to Mandalay interesting. Nice view. TV poor quality. Cable selection limited. Interesting atrium. Nice showerhead and water pressure.
"No frig, microwave or correct amount of sundries per person in room.  1 garbage can, and slow housekeeping response.  Mobile checkin didn't work for 10 in our different groups.  They rake in so much dough, they should do better.   We were in the pyramid.  Elevators slow and not all seemed to be working."
"Our room stunk of mildew.  There was a giant garbage can in the middle of the room to catch water, and another outside the door with water flowing in it constantly.  Staff are helpless because the problems are overwhelming.  Staying here will ruin your trip to Vegas."
"The Luxor looks like it would be fun, but it's really just a basic hotel that lacks even standard amenities like a fridge or microwave. The restaurants are limited and overpriced. There are limited elevators compounded by the fact that one of them was stuck on the 6th floor for the duration of our visit (5 days). Public restrooms were in bad shape. For example, the men's room in the food court area had only one urinal (out of 3) that was in service. Only one faucet was functional. The air hand dryers were broken, and there were no paper towels. I guess the Luxor doesn't really want you to use their restrooms, and they definitely don't want you washing your hands afterwards.

Hotel staff was generally friendly, but I am really disappointed. I guess this is the new version of Vegas, which is probably why they're struggling."
"This was my second stay at the Luxor.  The first time I stayed in the Tower, this time in the Pyramid.  This experience was a lot more fun.  The rooms are closer to the casino floor, restaurants, and exhibitions.  The rooms were comfortable, and some of the cleanest rooms that I have stayed in.  Definitely a great place to stay!"
From start to finish I had a great experience.  The rooms were very clean.  The staff was very friendly.  The beds were comfortable.  I have stayed at the Luxor every time I go to Vegas and it hasn’t disappointed me yet!!
"The staff is exceptional, the rooms are super clean and the spa is great! The price and location are a great bonus. The only ""problem"" we always have is how long the elevators take. Other than that, everything was amazing as always."
For the price of our room and the quality of the room the price was a little high. The keycards are also a hassle. We had multiple friends and family members staying in all sorts of rooms in all corners of the hotel. It was a pain to coordinate with them to go to their rooms. The bed could also be a little more comfortable
"It was a good value, located on the strip and close to all the venues. It was very decent for the price. The Luxor has many restaurants and bars, very good ones at that. We enjoyed the super bowl party at the Public House and it was excellent food, drinks, and good times."
"1) In our room, the bathroom sink wouldn’t drain properly. 2) It seems like self park is too far and penalizing to families who need a vehicle for various reasons. 3) the mobile app kept room key worked intermittently in elevators."
My husband and I came for our 20th anniversary.  We were pleased with allowing early check in and detailed directions to our room. Our room was very quiet and clean. Only down side was being further down the strip. We had an amazing time!
"The theme of our stay at the Luxor was sort of wild free spirited, this beautiful hotel is conveniently located near the Las Vegas strip, and has fabulous artistic environment that welcomed a diverse crowd of people; we loved our family stay at the Luxor so much that we plan to be there again! Thank you!"
"The Luxor is a fine hotel and resort. The staff are professional and friendly, the building and grounds are well maintained and the casino offers many options and games.
The Luxor is on the far southern end of the Strip, which makes visiting attractions more of a challenge due to the distance. There is a tram to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay, but we felt it was less distance to use the walkway instead. 
We did not get to use the pools at Luxor, as we visited out of season, the pool available to use (at Mandalay Bay) was excellent."
If you like the waiting after you check in time even with early check in this is your place and not receiving notifications when it is ready and having to carry your belongings around because they didn’t even offer you to check them it is great
"Hotel right at end of strip so walk or bus to the main strip, the hotel was big felt pressured to upgrade our room as we arrived early and they said our room not available. Pressured into going to a timeshare place they wouldn't leave us along until we said we would go. Room basic and no tea-coffee making facilities and the bathroom need a lot of TLC. We loved Vegas and will go back but stay in one of the other hotels."
"I was in town for a tournament with my daughter. We had requested an early check in and late check out for an extra $30 and $20. At check in the man/employee at the front was rude because he didn't see the request. He then left for 10 minutes and I was just left standing there wondering what was going on. After he comes back I tell him not to worry about it and he got mad at me because he said he took the time to go look for a room as if I was supposed to know that and that he was doing me the favor. He was just rude. 

The room was dusty and crumby. I didn't want to complain since I had already had a terrible experience at check in. Never Again!! Better to pay the full price than save. 

The housekeeper however was so nice,"
"Luxor double booked our room so they down graded us. Fine, it sucks but at least we still had a room.  Would have been nice if they could have at least given us clean room.  Pee on the toilet seat, dirty carpet, obviously hadn't been properly cleaned.  Tried to get ahold of the front desk and never reached anyone, just kept getting put back on hold.  Won't stay here again."
"Room was not very clean. No fridge, closet and the air didn’t seem to work well. It was a place to sleep but that’s it. I would not pick there to stay as my first choice. The people at the front asking to give you show vouchers was not my favorite thing every single time you walk through the lobby."
"I was disgusted, since I approached the check in desk with her for almost 45 minutes we’re told she’s gonna see if they have a room for us and all the rest of the terrible things followed afterwards from the smelly rooms. There is sheets if you go on forever."
"Water leaked through the ceiling of the room I was staying in right above where my suitcase was laying open, which completely drenched every item of clothing, my jacket and my phone charger. I went to the check in desks and explained the leak and damage to my belongings and she told me she would have maid service come clean any mess the leak was causing and in the meantime... I could use towels to soak up what I could. I told her that this was no small drip type leak. It was a running faucet type leak. She said ""well it is raining out right now"". I asked if there was someone else I could speak to and she walked away leaving me to assume she was getting a co-worker or her manager but then came right back and said ""I can move u to a different room, but as u can see... We are busy so if u were expecting to be upgraded - that's not going to happen"" I told her I was not looking for anything other than a dry room, and she could have someone in maintenance come fix the problem instead of changing my room since the hotel did look very busy. She changed my room anyway and had a horrible attitude like I was making her job so difficult. When I go to Vegas, I stay at the Luxor or the Delano. I will no longer book my room at the Luxor, nor will I shop, eat or gamble at the Luxor anymore, which was a hard decision because of the awesome bartenders and how fun and lively it gets. Sorry Luxor but you lost a loyal patron."
"Everything from the Vip Lounge Service, Housekeeping, Engineer Service, Limo Drivers to the Casino/Hotel Front Desk Representatives were truly Outstanding!  The Suite was clean, the temperature was great and the beds and other furniture were comfortable.  We loved all the plump pillows as well.  When we called about an issue with the television volume it was fixed within the hour.  Check in was a breeze and I checked out utilizing the television without any issues and dropped out room keys into the drop box in the elevator lobby. Location for us was not an issue as we used the tram for other strip locations and called an Uber and spent a day downtown. I really had nothing to complain about."
Stayed here for the half marathon weekend.. everything went well from the location to the start line. Plenty of food options around. Check-in and checkout was fast and simple. Overall decor of the casino was a good experience.
"We stayed at the Luxor based on childhood memories of my favorite hotel of our family Vegas trips. Not much has changed since the early 2000's and many of the rooms are in need of upgrades and repair. I was honestly disappointed with the state of the rooms, especially given the prices. 

Location on the Strip is great with walkways to Mandalay Bay and a tram between Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay made for convenient walking. 

Customer service was great, Location is so convenient. 
However, the rooms are outdated and not worth the price."
"We booked the Luxor as it was a bit more affordable than other places we have stayed previously on the strip and I wasn't actually expecting that much. I was pleasantly surprised at the comfort of the room, easy self-parking, and convenience to Mandalay Bay which had some restaurants we wanted to eat at during our stay."
"Housekeeping cleaned my room despite my request not to. They took ALL the soap & I had to call 4x to get soap. I nearly missed attending an expensive show because of their incompetence. And then they did it the next day too. The tub tap leaked continuously and had hard water build-up caked all over the faucet. Environmentally irresponsible. 

I didn’t need an alarm clock. I woke up at the crack of dawn when they started blowing debris off of the turf outside. 

Had a couple rude & inconvenient experiences at the Registration desk too. 

Considering the weekend nights were over $500, you might as well stay somewhere nicer, cleaner and with competent staff."
"While not the most luxurious property on the strip, the Luxor was very nice for the cost of the room, it was also close to my conference hotel.  New upgrades were evident in the rooms (wallpaper and dresser) and the bed linens were thick and plush.  There are never enough Starbucks anywhere during the morning conference rush, but that was the only downside."
"I reserved a elite suite in June 2022 and I was told there were no elite suites available. They gave me an extra $150 for the problem but I didn’t care about the money. They should have the room you reserved that you reserved 7 months before you arrived, and there was no communication from the resort before I arrived."
"Dirty rooms, poor service. No hot water for showers. Ripped sheets. Earring left on nightstand from previous guest. Parts of the hotel/casino smell like sewer and the ceilings were leaking. Very cheap place."
Luxor hotel was an amazing experience first time staying there but will definitely stay there again on my next trip! I will definitely let friends and family know to stay there as well when going out to Vegas !
The location is a bit far from the action of the strip. Some of the rooms a very outdated.  But if your stay in the towers if feels like a completely different hotel. I will only stay in the towers. The rooms are way more updated. They might be a little smaller but it’s worth it.
It was ok at best the room was clean and checking in was all right the parking was a nightmare and the room service lady walked in our room was out knocking and caught me and my wife making love so that was an issue
"I don't understand the bad reviews at all! The hotel is a little dated, but the rooms were nice and staff at the hotel and the casino were awesome. Food options were great, gambling was fun. I would stay here for the money anytime.  The outdoor area around the parking lot was a little trashed but that is because we rented a car and self parked."
"The only thing positive was the nostalgia of early 2000s.
I was charged $446 when I was supposed to be charged $343. I tried to checkin using app and it didn’t work so I waited in line for 30min. Horrible experience only then to be overcharged."
"First time experience and Luxor.  Clean, courteous and friendly staff, easy to navigate with space enough to not make you feel like cattle. Buffet Breakfast offered lots of choices and was clean and constantly presentable. Thank you"
"People movers were down between properties, water was cold for showers, and the pipes were loud all night we thought the neighbors were having  good squeaky fun all night. We're passed on by site staff for MGM Rewards items to go to another property."
"The rooms were nice. Bathrooms were clean and updated. The restaurant selection inside was decent and the location was perfect. The hallways were a little gross and sometimes smelled, and our hot water was not great. It wasn’t cold, but my  lukewarm shower was not my favorite. But that was really the only bad thing I could think of. I would absolutely stay here again."
"Room cleanliness could use some work, behind the tub u could tell where people laid there head and was stained or not clean. A/C would not get very cool no matter how low we set it. Other than that it was decent for the price."
"I received a complimentary night at the Luxor, so I took advantage and stayed. The room was clean, the sports book had plenty of available seating, and the ice machine was close to my room. MGM doesn't disappoint with their hotels."
There was a rain storm that leaked into our rooms.  I had booked 3 rooms and 2 of the 3 rooms had water leaks from the rain. One even dampen clothing from the leak. I had called to notify them of the leak and they said they would be sending someone to take a look but no one came. When I checked out they said they had no record of the call and had just only taken off the resort fees for two of the 3 rooms for one night.  I'm not really satisfied with the resolution and the service received. I didn't feel valued.
"Hotel was clean and beds comfortable.   The only downside was there isn't a refrigerator, microwave, or coffee pot in the room.  All the staff were friendly. I would definitely stay there again for the price."
Nice relaxing time hanging out with friends having a good meal mostly relaxing and enjoying these off work having a few drinks at night not having to worry about getting up early the next day being able to catch up with friends
Kind friendly staff quite rooms clean room had no issues only thing we didn’t care for was the parking that you have to pay for why pay for for parking when your paying for the room already other than that no issues
I had a blast in Las Vegas and the hotel was a great stay great price overall staff was good friendly except  when you got to the tables to gamble a lot of the managers on tables that were in charge what kind of I'm welcoming and acted better than everybody they can definitely use some friendliness advice and have to welcome guests overall pretty good stay.
"The staff were friendly, there are great amenities, and easy access to other casinos. The building needs some updates, especially the hotel rooms. I was expecting something a little different based on the photos I saw when making my reservation, especially in the bathroom. The rooms have no fridge or microwave which can be helpful when staying for an extended amount of time like we did. Overall, I would recommend and would probably stay here again."
"The heat barely worked it was always cold in the room and we had to mess with the heat a lot to try to get it to warm up the other heater didn't work it was blowing out air the hot tub was not cleaned when we tried to put water in it a whole bunch of black stuff was coming out of the drain check-in was horrible cards were not working but when we use them elsewhere in the hotel they work just fine we kept calling our car company and they kept telling us it was something wrong with Luxor our room was not ready when we got there it took about 4 hours to get in the room they kept on telling us that maybe we didn't have money on our car we had $10,000 on it so that wasn't true. It was my birthday I had appointments I couldn't go in the room and take a shower I had people waiting for a birthday dinner we had stuff to do it was such an inconvenience and at the very end they offered to take a deposit when they could have done that 4 hours ago so I could at least get in the room and shower we came down and paid immediately after my husband's flight got in. Yeah I'm not leaving food we have to keep coming up and down the elevator walking through the casino to get a food delivery that's also an inconvenience a couple of times I came back to my room my door was open we had to keep on constantly checking if anything was missing there was definitely a do not disturb sign on the door nothing was cleaned so it's like who the F was opening my door.  the room was much smaller than it looked like in the picture. There was also never any indication upon booking that there was construction or anything a lot of people were complaining about that on the elevator. And I do have pictures to prove all of this stuff. Can barely get the front desk to answer the phone during certain times this place cost way too much money bunch of hidden fees even if you do pay on the MGM website"
"my daughter lost her passport, credit cards and other documents, she hasn't received enough support from luxxor hotel, we hope somebody could help us, its a Dominican passport, her name is Jennifer Vidal Sanchez, my phone number is 809-8504934, we appreciate any help..."
"Our family gathered for our grandson's 21st Birthday.  Staff was very helpful with any questions or concerns.  Staff at check in, was friendly an welcoming.  We stayed in the Pryamid, so the rooms were dated, but comfortable and clean."
"Horrible room.  Less quality than a Motel 6.   For over $350, we had a room that smelled of smoke, no deadbolt on door, section of carpet missing in front of HVAC unit, TV did not work (cable was not connected on back), bath vent was pulled loose from wall, trash can in bathroom was rusty, outlet cover missing from wall near TV,  furniture was scratched and worn.  

For the price paid, you would also expect glasses and not plastic cups, a coffee maker, minibar and refrigerator, and hopefully a real closet and not just a bar in the room to hang clothes on.  

In addition, in order to save time, we checked in via the mobile app, and obtained a digital room key.    It did not work, in any elevator, so I went to the front desk to get a physical key.   The line was 50+ people long.   I went to the concierge desk, and was advised to use the mobile check-in desk to obtain a physical key.   However, it requires a QR Code, which I had not received.   So only other option was to stand in line with all other people checking in.   Not a great start to a vacation."
The hotel tried to charge my card 4 times in less than 3 hours for charges that were not mine but the person u had my room before me! Even after figuring the issue out they still tried to charge my card! The manager pretty much told me not to worry the charges  aren’t going through ( luckily i moved my money around) He also said the hotel will figure it out in some days and then they will stop trying to charge you
"I can’t recommend staying at the property. They sold out our room and offered us small compensation, and after going back and forth to the back a few times (about 30 min in total), we just gave in as we checked in late. Then our room was not clean as the surfaces were sticky and everything was dusty. Hallway floors (we were in the west tower) had stains all 4 days and there was puke in the elevator for most of one day. The restaurants and shows were great, but check in and general service were very poor."
"We originally had a room on the first floor. The grandkids did not like it, it was to far from the front area. I asked for a different room and they gave us a room in the 1st tower 27th floor. A super great experience for the kids. They loved it!"
"I needed a cheap-ish hotel because of the price I paid for my Adele ticket and this one was great! It’s in a good location and has a lot to offer. It’s at the end of the strip, and is connected to Mandalay Bay & the Excalibur by a tram and walkways. The buffet isn’t that good, but there’s other food options onsite that I didn’t try. Download the mobile app and do the mobile check in, it’s so easy! I paid a little extra for early check in and my room was ready for me before I landed. You can also make your own physical room keys once you check in on the app so you don’t have to wait in line to speak with someone."
We enjoyed our stay!  Ruth and management took excellent care of us at check-in and made our anniversary special!!!  Stephanie and all the staff provided excellent service at the Pyramid Cafe!  Our room was nice and clean.  One of our best stays in Vegas ever (and we've stayed at several high end to mid priced strip hotels)!!!
No bad review Stay was awesome  Location was everything located on the strip. Customer service was awesome  5 stars for sure Family & pet friendly! Uber/lyft friendly very easy to manage and move. Food was awesome as well.
Stay was ok. Rooms need refurbished. Store employees were very pushy at some stores. Too many kids running around the hotel and the casino. Thought kids were not allowed in casinos other then to reach the restaurants.  If we come back to Vegas we will stay elsewhere.
"I used to love coming to mgm bc of the mlife program and all of the befits, I was platinum and it comes with a bunch of perks, this last time I went I realized they dropped me down to sapphire and started me over to 0"
Second visit great experience staff was very accommodating the rooms were clean and pool was big and clean. Location is on the lower end of the strip which was a good location. Enjoyed the Egyptian theme.
"I liked staying there. Coffee places were convenient but the check in person I got was nice enough but not inviting. I think he was overworked. The cleaning staff was very nice, and I did find the breakfast buffet was very good"
"I really didn’t want to stay in the Luxor after reading so many negative reviews however was pleasantly surprised. 

Check in was easy we got upgraded to a tower room which has a lovely view. 

Cleaning was variable and the cleaning staff was very rude to us on our last day walking in twice without locking telling us “time to go” even though we had a late checkout and was trying to rest before a late flight. 

The resort fee is annoying but pretty standard in vegas. We enjoyed staying at this end of the strip as it’s much quieter and we enjoy walking. 

I would suggest in you are a couple you make sure both your names are on the room booking. I had a unpleasant incident being locked out of the room late at night as my key wouldn’t work and as the booking was only in my partners name they wouldn’t replace the key, it took two hours of calling for them to wake him up and check it was okay. This is clearly great from a security view but it placed me in a very vulnerable position.  

There was not coffee machine in the room which was annoying and the queues to Starbucks was huge at the weekend. We enjoyed walking through to Mandalay the bear in there are fab! 

Although we had some grumbles  we would certainly stay in the hotel particularly as this is always reasonably priced."
"Clean rooms, friendly staff, fun museums and many options to eat inside the hotel. Easy access to other hotels but be prepared to walk long distances. We had lots of fun. The hotel also have a couple of bars with good music."
"It was an average room, a little bit stuff on floor, under the table in the room, melted ice in ice bucket, so I assume it was left there by someone else, since we didn’t get to the hotel until after 11:30pm, it should have been spotless…and the resort fee, when you book through the airline is not included in the price of your room…"
"Hotel needs a lot of TLC and a regular graffiti cleaning crew, wow. The elevators are an experience, kinda like riding in a subway or public transit. 
Unfortunately the Luxor has gone down hill over the years and apparently nobody cares. Stay way for now, maybe some change will come in the future. There is no way, I’m the only person who feels this way.."
"I was at the property for two nights and it was like being in two different properties. The first night I was in the Pyramid. I read the rooms had been updated. I'm not sure that's true. The elevators and halls were worse than the room which was very dated. The biggest problem was my inability to get a cell single in my room.

I moved to the tower the next morning. Much newer, more up to date, and well-maintained. And, my cell phone worked!"
"This property is a little far south on the strip and older, but it is very nice for the price l, the rooms in the towers are very nice as well. There are areas that need some help but this place is fun"
Did not receive the view I purchased and requested. Room was dusty and hair from previous guest or housekeeping was all over bathroom. Shower drain was clogged and shower head was covered in soap scum. No refrigerator or microwave. Had to throw out meals I paid good money for. Not even an a small coffee pot. I’ve stayed at basic hotels and gotten better amenities than I did here. They only thing good about this place was the staff was nice. Highly doubt I would recommend or stay here again ever. Also did mobile checkin at the advice of the hotel. Also a waste of time as I still had to go back to the desk and get keys because the card readers in the elevator didn’t work with my digital key.
Luxor was enticing for us due to our interest in Egyptian culture. The hotel clearly disappointed both in terms of rooms as well as overall service. Everything is old and feels like a 2 star motel. Staff doesn't work on any requests you make. Really unpleasant experience.
"Mold in the refrigerator, panel on the soaking tub was broke and lying on the ground. Was told I couldn’t get a new room because they were completely booked, but would send maintenance up immediately. Maintence never came and the issues were not fixed in my 3 day stay"
There are much better hotel options in Vegas. Nothing spectacular to experience here. It was said this is the motel 6 of the strip. Rooms are not secure- slots odds are bad- tables are few and crowded- everything is too expensive- add that to paying for parking and no comps- it sucked.
"Had to use the key to get up the elevator.  Only one elevator led to the 21st floor so there was a lot of walking around to get to the room. Everything very expensive, but that's Las Vegas for you.  Check in wasn't the friendliest- asked about a shuttle for the airport and only answer I got was there isn't one. I liked that the hotels were connected so you can shop throughout a few hotels. Had to figure out the parking at first."
Poor service and the employee's we delt with were not helpfull or rude! Housekeeping services took forever! The parking pass didn't let us in or out most of the time. Rooms smelled like mildew. Won't stay there again.
"Great rewards. Amazing service. The total package. I would definitely stay here again. There was a mix up with my room, but the ladies at the VIP counter took care of me, gave me a better room, and also $150 credit for the inconvenience"
"In desperate need of maintenance and housekeeping services. Took us 3 tries to get an acceptable clean room and almost 3 hours of going back and forth to the front desk. 
Baggage handlers were not present when trying to unload in incredibly busy drop off line. Elevators with missing electronics panels and took multiple times to read room cards to get to our level, which we seen multiple people have the same issue having to ride up and down until card was read to let off on desired floor. Visible dirt, debris, spills throughout casino floor and hallways, elevators."
First time to Vegas and not impressed by what I saw compared to what my friends told me it was like. They stayed at different resorts and had a great time. If I go back I will stay else where. Sad to say but not worth my money I paid
Never again will i stay here they don't have cameras in the hall ways if they take some thing from your room they don't have a way to see who toke it and they just don't care they give you a lot of bs
Room was very spacious and clean and the self check-in was awesome we avoided the lines and went straight to our room and used our phon for key. We will definitely be back and stay again soon. The cleaning lady we had was very friendly.
Booked a room here for Super Bowl weekend for under $100 per night! The room was nice and comfortable. Hotel is in a good location with a tram that takes you to neighboring casinos. Good options if you're looking for a quick bite to eat on property.
Manager make me feel like I’m stupid for not using my food credit but the front desk told me I can use it for next time I visit even tho I ask him if there anything I can do if I k ow that I can’t use for my next visit I would’ve use the credit management is not helpful at all at least you do t have to make me feel stupid.
"I was very disappointed in the Luxor this time on my trip to Vegas.  The room was average - stayed in the Tower.  We had breakfast at the Pyramud Cafe on our first morning and paid $65 for a mediocre meal at best.  The eggs were cold, bacon greasy and coffee lukewarm.  The service was slow and it was not even busy.  

After that we had breakfast at the buffet in the Excelsior and it was much better for the cost.  

We wanted to take the bus to Fremont Street and not one of the staff we spoke to knew how to use the transit system.  The cost was much less than Uber or taxi and it was very in -expensive way to get around once we figured out where to get on it. We even used it to get to the airport for our return flight.  

Overall we had a good holiday but would stay at one of the  hotels on the strip, not offset like the Luxor."
"Our stay in the 2 bedroom tower suite was the worst.  Outdated, Dirty,  worn out, nasty shower head, and broken chairs and bar seats made of wicker that had holes cut through them. Very disappointed.. Smoke free it was not. Housekeeping and their masking the smell made it even worse with the chemical that they sprayed THROUGHOUT and all over everything to hide it. So, why not wear that smell out as it settled in everything we brought to wear."
The room style was very nice. But i felt it wasnt very clean. The carpet was disgusting that i didnt want to walk on it barefoot or even in just socks. The bedding had hairs throughout and i questioned if it was a fresh set of bedding or if the bed was just remade from the previous guest
"Good place to enjoy, but the location is pretty lacking. The food choices are average, no upscale dining. The coffee shops are plentiful, but you will spend money on taxis to get around. The connection to Mandalay Bay great."
"Paid $50 for show tickets that I never received and paid $40 in Uber to get to the location of the show tickets to be conned into a $15,000 time share! Also the app does not work for check-in, my advise: visit the counter for a person instead of waiting hours for nothing."
"Very friendly staff, great service, clean room. Casino floor was very roomy, lots of slot machines to choose from. Good arrangement of table games. Drink girls are awesome, always coming around asking if you want anything."
"The room while clean had A very springy bed and it was hard, it’s an older hotel so it’s not the best beds. The “inclinatior” had some broken panels which made getting up and down the floors of the hotel a bit sketchy. 

But the staff was friendly and we had no real complaints"
"Worst experience I have ever had at a hotel especially in Vegas I would never recommend this to anybody not even a stranger or someone I didn’t even like. The customer service is horrible Management is not good either and the rooms were dirty especially during these Covid times I was shocked how dirty this was. Please avoid this place at all cause he will be disappointed if you stay here. The only good thing was our host Leah who helped organize some of the things we wanted to do other than that it was all terrible. The food at the buffet takes like frozen food, Lilian an employee there is the worst customer service I’ve ever had, Chicken is a long line and definitely do not opt for them to take your luggage because you will not receive it and you will have to make the extra trips back-and-forth to get it."
"There is a strong smoke smell throughout the property.  This was very hard to get away from due to the pyramid design of the building.  Fridges are also not provided in the rooms, and only available at an extra charge."
Always a great stay at the lux need more time here and can’t complain about too much although there are somethings I would change. Also the pools were not open and were in construction this whole trip advertise next time pls
"The Luxor is the best.  Not too fancy, not to shabby- just right! The rooms in the Pyramid are our favorite and the entertainment options are great! Check out the Public House for dining.  Great food in a Sports Bar motif."
"Loved our stay and having a mini fridge and a coffee maker in the room! Beds were comfy, nice deep bathtub and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and will be back for sure!"
Dogs pissing on floors--Smell of weed everywhere--impossible to get assistance unless you go down to the front desk. No one answers the phone--TV  kept loosing contact.  The stations were all sports. Poor Y-FI
"Resort fees are unacceptable--especially if the pool is CLOSED.  The design of the hotel's rooms are classic but not installing modern amenities to a room is ridiculous. At least include USB for device charging. The refrigerator in the room had food from previous guests. The television offering was extremely poor. Again, resort fees pay for what? Drastically expensive for not much."
"Too expensive, for a room that doesn't even have a coffee machine, not even a cooler, parking is expensive, Food Fair food is bad and expensive, actually I wouldn't recommend this place at all, there are better options for everything which is paid in the Luxor."
"If you can get a decent rate at Luxor and need to save money, it isn't a horrible place to stay. Maybe our tastes are a bit snobby but the only part of the trip we enjoyed was not being on property.

The room wasn't dirty, but it felt old and dingy. The AC had a hard time blowing cold air in Feb. Around the property feels either dated or empty as if they're ready to move out. The elevators I'm the pyramid can be in unfortunate positions where you have to go through a maze to get to the main floor.

Mirage was our hotel of choice, great people, excellent rooms for the price, but Luxor just cannot be a replacement. If you can swing a few more dollars, try NYNY, although I admit we have yet to stay there, only play.

If your expectations are low, you'll be fine staying here. If your standards are mid/high I would avoid Luxor."
Too far from strip. Beds and pillows are not comfortable. Takes forever to get hot water. Some restaurants don’t open until later so if you like to eat dinner before 5:30 you have to go elsewhere. Staff are pleasant
Staff was very accommodating  I love everything about this casino from the front to the best of the departments thank you luxor I will recommend this casino to every kitty was very nice there was another lady but I forgot her name she checked me in she was also accommodating very nice lady
"The hotel is little bit dated but overall it was a good experience. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful during my time there. At this time, I wouldnt recommend paying extra for a suite unless it was renovated. It just isnt worth the extra money in my opinion."
All in all was a very good stay just Need to be updated I would of loved to have a microwave or mini fridge in room even a coffe maker it is Vegas late nights lots of drinking I need coffee lol my stay was good tho
I need someone from the company to make this right for me my room was dirty had old sheets and trash in the closet where I'm supposed to keep my stuff. The hall way and the elevator smelled like there was a really bad sewer pipe leak terrible smell
Room was fine sometimes wait fie elevator was a bit long 4 of them but only 1 or 2 working at a time. Casino waz not overly crowed lots of room to play and not feel jammed in . N8ce to be able to walk to the hotels on either side with out going outside.
"Friendly Staff
Carrot Top is a great show
Smell is alittle muggy. We stayed a few months ago and it was pleasant then.
Gambling area is comfortable. 
Gentlemen that took our bets for the Superbowl game was very helpful"
"Previously I primarily have said I wouldn't stay at the Luxor as in the past I thought it was over rated and over priced with the lack of hospitality and up keep with a poor floor plan. I unfortunately didn't follow that suggestion and had a friend stay at the resort, So I decided to stay close to them. When I made the reservation through my company I was offered a rate that I thought was acceptable considering the time frame and the space availability. After agreeing to the booking price it was then changed to a higher rate. So after the the resort fee was charged I ended up paying more then twice the amount I agreed to for a place I really didn't want to be, so immediately I was drown back to being severely disappointed with the entire experience. Then there was the location of the room it was nowhere close to where I thought it was nor near my travel companions , it seemed to be about as far away as it could down a long deserted hallway that seemed like it should have been a staff entrance. All in all it made me feel like I was going to work/sleep in a toilet room. So #1 when you work at a company with 90k employees you get to see and hear a lot of experiences both good and bad and this experience brought my second chance right back to thinking the Luxor is #2. and with the ability to fly anywhere in the world that rare opportunity to spend time with family that doesn't fly at all, it was very disappointing. I agreed to a reservation price that was changed and the standard to addressing this issue is that its the app used to make the reservation. That is not at all correct in my opinion I have been using the same program for more than 30 years with my employer and I know that the prices are not dictated by them its an agreement from the vendor thus being MGM resorts. so for anyone to not own that is insulting."
I had so much fun with my family. The kids were able to get where they could have fun and they were safe as they didn't have to leave the building. It was blast and the food options were great. The beds were very comfy and the shower pressure was phenomenal
Our bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. Tv was hung in awkward position so hard to watch it from bed. Coffee shiop/restaurant off main floor closed at 3pm. Video poker machines were ancient and few in number.
Plenty space in my hotel. Check in was a little long but my company 711 had triple the amount of people since they bought speedway so it was understandable. Everyone was friendly and showed me where I had to go. Always shuttle for 7ee was available so that help my transportation a lot. Trade show showed a lot of new things I was so pleased. I will come back even for vacation lots of sites to see on the strip.
"The Luxor is dated.  Very dated.  After staying here many times over the years, it’s time for a different spot.  The inclinators in the pyramid.  Sheesh.  From top to bottom it’s time for a rehab of this hotel."
"The staff here were unwelcoming and generally rude. They all seemed to be irritated with our presence and didn't make any effort to be friendly or helpful. Even though you pay premium prices to stay at an MGM property, the experience was lackluster and I had much better experiences at Aria, Vdara, Venetian, and Palazzo."
"Don’t even think about staying at this property, even it is free. Rooms are terrible, casino might be the tightest of any place I’ve ever gambled. Elevator’s are extremely slow, no refrigerator or safe in my room. They only cleaned my room once during a four night stay! They need to bull doze this place down and rebuild something new or get new management."
"It was my first trip to Vegas. Had an amazing stay. Was in awe by the fixtures throughout the hotel. My room was very clean and comfortable. 
1 issue I did have, I was not aware you needed to use key card for elevator.  Should have been told at check in. I have stayed at other hotels that do not use this system. However I felt more secure. 
Thanks for your service."
"Vegas was my moms bucket list trip!
We seen Americas got talent Superstars and Tournament of Kings
Great shows!!!!  
The staff were all friendly and the service was good. Lots of shops and dining right in the Casino."
The Luxor has so much potential. Imagine the staying at the pyramids of giza and how Awsome that would be. At first glance that's what the Luxor is trying to accomplish but once you make it past the front desk you realize this is a run down old truck stop motel 8 in disguised as a pyramid. It's unfortunate.
Enjoyed my stay especially dinning in at Tender. Would definitely visit again . Rooms should come with refrigerator and microwave. Fix the digital key elevator access. Had to retreat to the old school card way
"Luxor is one of my favorite places to stay, the staff is amazing, food is good, when we requested more blankets they were brought quickly. The tram is a great quick way to get to two of the other casinos faster. We will be back again!"
"Beautiful hotel, friendly service. Love the Egyptian theme. Enjoyed the convenience of shopping inside of the hotel. Loved the night club Flight, which is opened 24/7. The Luxor souvenir pyramid cup, which is filled to the brim with an adult slushy, could last you the entire night! Loved it, had a great time, can’t wait to stay again!"
The staff was friendly with high energy. That was needed after a long flight from the east coast. The main restaurant had delicious food. The atmosphere felt private and the room was spacious.  I would most definitely stay there on vacation.
Rooms are absolutely disgusting definitely not what I thought I was getting and especially for the price. Super disappointed and will not ever stay here again. The staff is rude the whole building smells and compared to other casinos this one is the worst
"Our go to place when we are in Vegas which is several times a year. The place is clean, staff is friendly, ambience is nice. The rooms need a bit of updating but everything was nice and clean. We have stayed at most of the MGM properties and always come back to the Luxor."
This place was so cool and warming I like this place a lot I deff would recommend this place to anyone who want to be at a great hotel me and my friends got in the room quick and on time no problem need to go back again
Everything was perfect from when i landed my ride was right on time all the way up until we went home and the room was amazing and I wanted to thank Leah for setting up everything for me I really appreciate everything you do thanks Pat
"There's on set of elevators and my room was on the opposite side.  Long walk to get to the room.  The room looked nice and I was there on business.  I keep smelling a cleaning solution smell.  Not only in my room but in the whole hotel. Especially by the restrooms. It burned my nose and throat.  The toilet paper and tissues are so thin you have to fold them in half to be regular one ply.  The worst part is the internet would just stop working for 15 minutes and then work again,  I called wireless Service and they acted like that's the way it is.  I can't get any work done if I'm dropped and it can't connect to the server.  When I checked out they acted like that's normal and couldn't care less. Parking was $18"
Wonderful stay. Enjoyed several of the hotel’s excellent attractions. Great buffet. Loved the atmosphere of the pyramid. Will definitely stay here again. Easy to pick up Ubers and close to the airport.
We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this hotel. Just a little confusion about the check in because we've got to Las Vegas driving and had to self-park before checking in and walk to the check in area. This hotel has great amenities.
"Luxor Resort and Casino is a stunning oasis (pun intended) of luxury and excitement in the heart of Las Vegas. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that is both relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. The attention to detail and level of service provided by the staff is truly exceptional, making every guest feel like a VIP.

The rooms at Luxor are spacious and beautifully appointed, featuring modern amenities that make you feel right at home. Whether you're looking for a peaceful retreat or a high-energy escape, the resort has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and memorable.

Personally we made a short business trip which included my father and my wife.  We all love the overall ancient Egyptian theme of the resort, making it our primary reason for the stay.  Overall, the ancient Egyptian theme at Luxor adds a level of excitement and intrigue that is truly unique. It sets the resort apart from other Las Vegas destinations and creates an immersive experience that makes every guest feel like they are part of a fascinating and mysterious world.  As you approach the property, you are greeted by a massive 30-story pyramid that is reminiscent of the Great Pyramid of Giza, complete with a massive Sphinx statue standing guard at the entrance.

Whether you're in Las Vegas for business or pleasure, this resort is the perfect place to relax, indulge, and enjoy all the city has to offer. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable experience."
Found the music a little too loud in the evening when sitting in the bar to have drinks and gamble.   Would have liked water and coffee machine in the room for early morning rising.   But the room was fine. And staff pleasant.
Thebeds are vwry uncomfortable. Too much noise from room next door. Staff was not very friendly. Our trip was short but Long enough. The hotel was just ok. We will probably not stay at this hotel again.
"Please provide or offer credits to everyone 
I don’t have anything else to say. O please make sure to not use stained sheet. My sheet had a very dark stain on it made it a little on comfortable. I would like my credi or more on my next visit."
Amazing hotel on the strip lots close by to do... but the hotel had many things inside as well.... the buffet was delicious and had to take advantage of the bottomless mimosas... there is also a fat Tuesday's which was a plus for us and a late night food court open with many options.
Booked a room for the tower. Noisy room and terrible view. Absolutely horrible!!! This hotel needs to be remodeled. There was water leaking in the hallways on the 3rd floor. They did not clean it up swiftly.
"Mobile check in was fantastic, room needed updated amenities, shops were way over priced, pyramid cafe was great /staff friendly as can be…. Good variety of slots, could have been more table variety and more appealing minimums."
"Room was clean, beds were comfortable. Hot water in the shower worked. Loved how fast the elevators were, just didn't like how the key reader in the elevators didn't work all the time or give you time to put the key to it and choose your floor. Need better eating options in the hotel. Casino are was nice and all the workers were friendly. Registration desk was terribly slow. I checked in on my phone, but still needed keys made for the elevator. It was 1 o'clock in the morning and only 5 people ahead of me and I waited 30 minutes. Other than those few minor problems, I would definitely stay here again."
Enjoyed my Valentine's day stay. People were nice and had fun. Diablo restaurant was great! Shrimp tacos were delicious and waitress was pleasant. The rooms were cozy and comfy. I was able to access internet without any issues. I will visit again!
Love the Luxor Hotel. Definitely made first time in Vegas awesome. I wish there was a microwave and refrigerator. Also to be able to get towels was hard so if we could have gotten them more often that would be good.
"Location cleanliness and sleep quality, when you out all of them together that’s what I am looking for to enjoy a stay in a place and found that on my stay at Luxor hotel, I will book it again on my next stay in Vegas"
"Don't stay at this hotel. The Parking garage is too far from the casino floor, room towers and elevators. This hotel doesn't have adequate services for people with disabilities. My recommendation for further travelers to Las Vegas. If you want to stay at a very cheap hotel you can stay at the Luxor. If you prefer quality and comfort, don't stay at this hotel!!!!"
"Did not like paying for parking. The overall hotel was decent for gambling I like the casino layout.  The rooms were relatively clean but not the greatest attention to detail, dust around,  Also TV had poor quality needs replaced for what its worth"
"Busy schedule over 4 days, not one moment of interruption. Shows right there in the hotel help with a busy schedule to include some fun. And obviously the casinos. Be weary of a couple of the electronic store in the hotel as the products are not of good quality and over priced"
Had a great Superbowl Weekend at the Luxor again it's a yearly trip with family and friends. Took in the AGT LIVE show and it was great. In the past we have seen Carrot Top and the Blue Man Group also all great shows.
"room was terrible, filthy, no fridge, carpet dirty, over-all terrible.
when we asked to be moved we were told that we'd have to pay more because we rec'd such a great deal ""thats why we rec'd the room we got"" (so basically we got what we paid for) so Luxor deals means its a MAJOR DOWN GRAGE"
"I didn't request an accessible room, but got one assigned to me. There was no water handheld spot on the top to take a shower comfortably. The curtain wasn't long enough, so all the shower water flooded the bathroom floor. I slipped and had to use up all the towels to soak up the water."
Do not waste your time doing here please take the time to shop around at different hotels that respects their guest and honor what they tell you I was Lured in and lied to you and taken advantage of!!
"My room key did not operate the elevator so, I had to make the long walk back from the elevator to the front desk three times before they decided to give me a room in another tower. I was told at check-in that my room would not be available for two days of my stay due to a convention.  There was music playing all night outside my window the entire stay. The occupants of the room next to us were very loud and noisy late into the night. At times it seemed as if we were sharing a room with them. The maids failed to clean our room on the second day of our stay. We left the hotel and returned later that afternoon. Their cart was parked across the hall from us so we assumed that they would be taking care of our room next. That did not happen. My wife eventually went out to ask about room service and they had moved down the hall by that time. She just asked for clean towels and face cloths as at that point we were tired and wanted a nap. We will no longer consider the Luxor for future stays in Las Vegas."
Was my birthday week and you guys had no special things you do for birthdays plus the rooms were out dated for the price I paid it was not a good stay I will not be recommending this place or staying there anymore
It was just a bad experience that cost too much. The food had a lesser quality tha mcdonalds but cost as much as a fine dining experience.  Don't eat here.  You can only travel to the floor you stay on.  Check in takes forever. The rooms smell of mold and the furniture is musty.  It's in a bad location making it expensive to get around.
"Everything was good except the digital card hardly worked in the elevators.  Also wish there was a fridge and microwave to heat leftovers.  Overall, it was a good place to sleep and relax for the weekend."
"The place is old and dirty, not well maintained. Better to stay at Caesar’s or Belagio for the same price. The staff was very friendly and helpful though. After a fairly messy check in process they gave us a penthouse that wound up having bugs in it. Didn’t stay for the second night."
"Location is everything on my vacation and this one is exceptional, clean room, great breakfast at the restaurant and the entire experience was great. Thanks to the staff and I really recommend that you use their app to make the check in process and pay your parking in advance, doing this you are going to Save a lot of your time."
The Luxor was great. The only issue we had was that the thermostat could not be set lower than 65. We were hot a few times. Items in the little shop were expensive but you expect that when you go to Vegas. The Service was outstanding.
"Rooms do not include refrigerators, microwave or coffee pot. This was not communicated ahead of time, may be in the small print, but I did t see it. They want you to pay additional fees for these items and will BS you by telling you it’s because people were tearing them up when Covid started. Well, that’s BS, the real reason is they want to nickel and dime you to death!!"
"Great restaurants great shows fun time to just allow yourself to refuel & reward yourself. Truly a wonderful way to escape the grind and eat, drink from many fun and  great restaurants. An adventure in one location without ever having to leave the resort. A wonderful way to rejuvenate a worn out mindset."
"The pyramid is an exceptional place to explore with live music, fun games, and good food! The staff was exceptional! The spa is very pleasant and relaxing. The shows were great and the views were breathtaking!"
"The room was very dark. Poor ventilation and felt very humid after shower. Everything felt dingy. Ceiling had water damage marks and some look 
like mold. Poor choice of food. First hotel that I have been to that did not have a refrigerator."
"This trip was one to remember. Very friendly staff that greeted you warmly and treated you kindly. Displayed patience when I had card difficulties from traveling out of state, awarded me a food credit when my hotel keys didn't work. Overall I was well taken care of!"
Really nice experience. I got the reservation from a third party. But yet everything worked fine. The room was clean and seamed renewed recently. We were in a family plan with kids and the experience was really friendly.
"If you come here expecting the luxury of Bellagio or Aria you'll likely be disappointed but that is an unfair expectation. Luxor is great for the more down to earth Vegas experience with reasonable prices, clean and nicely appointed rooms, plenty of restaurants, late night food (Waypost Deli !) and fun casino. Plus the pyramid design is just amazing. Easily walk to Mandalay Bay or Excalibur for even more options. We love the fancier MGM options as well, but Luxor is our main Vegas destination!"
"For being on The Strip, rates are pretty good. Not sure if I’ll stay again, but it was decent enough I’ll recommend to others. The room was very basic, which I was expecting at those prices, they also have blackout curtains, so don’t have to worry about the light keeping you up! Checkin was probably the fastest and most expedited I’ve ever experienced, which has its positives and negatives. First hotel checkin I’ve ever done that no conversation, other than what was absolutely necessary to checkin, was had. Thankfully, I’m the sort to walk around and explore, so figured out most stuff on my own. For those interested, use of hot tub is a separate charge, was $30/person (per visit) when we went. Which was more than I was willing to pay. Used to spending a full day at a Korean day spa at that price. But at least it looks fairly nice from the pictures. Fairly quick access from here to Mandalay Bay to Excalibur. There’s also a bus stop just outside and the Deuce travels up and down The Strip fairly fast for a city bus. Overall, location and stay was fairly decent. If you’re looking for a basic place with good room rates, I would recommend this place. Just remember, if you’re also looking for free parking, you’ll likely be looking outside The Strip. Parking is only free if you’re of a higher level tier in their membership, or military (which is a different membership card, they count retirees as well!)."
"Our room was spacious with 2 double beds, great power shower and toiletries but no kettle or fridge. There is a good bar downstairs opposite the checkin desk serving beer and simple cocktail mix ( spirit + soft drink ) for $5 + tax ( the Aurora) . Usually this would be $11-16 elsewhere. 
The lifts go diagonally and the balcony from the higher floors are vertiginous but we had a great time there. Easy walkways through to the Excalibur and New York New York and to Mandalay bay. It’s about a 45-50 minute walk from the Belagio and the bus ‘Deuce’ serves the area well - riding all the way up to the Mob museum and Fremont Street. Unfortunately the natural history museum was shut at 4 pm on Sundays. Deuce drives past many shotgun wedding venues!! Fun"
"I've stayed away from the Luxor because of whay I've heard in the past about being out dated but a convention was going on and all the other Casinos had raised their prices way up. Luxor pricing was the best around and was nice to see that everything had received a facelift. Beautiful resort with very nice rooms. My only complaint is having to use key card to access your floor. That was a pain when youre trying to use your digital key and no signal. so make sure you have a physical card on the elevator. Oh, and the water pressure is amazing. Best shower of my life. lol"
Great Vibe at this property!  The check in process with the app is great!  The buffet was incredible!  Food court and cafe are perfect to feed your craving.  The bar in the middle of casino has the best happy hour! Perfect Place!
"Biggest issue was no cell service at all in the room and that issue was never resolved and frankly not sure anyone tried. Tech support was hard to reach, difficult to understand, and not helpful. Bluetooth keys did not work well. Guests should get the plastic keys"
"Checked in after a long day and only realised (half way to the room) that the room allocated by the receptionist wasn't the Pyramid Premier Two Queen I had booked, so trudged back to reception, queued saw a different receptionist who told me that it was hotel policy to ""upgrade"" Virgin Holiday customers to a Tower room but offered a change to a Pyramid room but commented in his opinion it would be a downgrade. So, despite my B.S. meter twitching, took the tower room.

Actually the room was quite adequate and comfortable, but not as absolutely clean as I'd have expected on arrival. and despite the beds and towels being changed every day of our 7 night stay the cleanliness of the room didn't improve, with area's of dust remaining untouched and physical evidence either a better vacuum cleaner was needed or one needed to be used, but maybe the ambiance was supposed to be as dusty and dirty as a newly unearthed Pyramid(?). In deciding whether or not to complain I gauged it was possibly no dirtier than my home (before I clean) and considered my health was not at risk - so didn't complain. So why is my review even mentioning this? It's a note to help other Trippers decide whether to stay at the Luxor.
I came to the conclusion that these hotel chains can spend as much as they like of refurbishments but if the building isn't kept clean it (in my opinion) is money wasted.
The hotel itself is at one end of the Strip and if I were to go to Vegas again, this would help my decision not to book the Luxor again 

Having walked through many of the Strip / Casino's during my stay I would say Excalibur and New York New York were probably built at the same time as the Luxor and ""themed"" hotels have passed their sell by for me."
"The hotel was extremely noisy (at my room), with loud music playing all night.
Check out took us 45 minutes as we needed to correct the double charge at the parking, this has pushed all our road trip plans late of course!
The hotel is BEAUTIFUL though!"
How can such a nice place not have little refrigerators and especially coffee makers OR a coffee bar? I don’t wanna wait 15 minutes and pay 7$ at Starbucks. The rooms otherwise were good and clean and quiet. Checking in was kind of crazy as the lines were huge but they did have a mobile check in which helped.
"Nice and clean and convenient.  No  in room coffee makers.  Not happy about that at all especially when I called in advance to ask and was told coffee makers were in the rooms. C
Room was clean and I need the location for a seminar."
Good location with good views.  Good entertainment. Rooms were clean and very spacious with very comfortable beds.  We will Most definitely will stay there again.  Easy to get to other casinos from that location
Took 45 minutes to check in and we were on hold to reach housekeeping for another 45 mins. Took almost an hour for an extra blanket to arrive. Elevator and ever wall has something amiss - just so beat up. Shower was clean and water was hot but that is about all I can say was good
"Beds were comfortable but overall the entire casino, hotel, rooms all need a good deep cleaning and maintenance! Many of the dealers never say thank you when tipped. Elevators in very poor condition, don’t open with sensors, emergency panels wide open…"
Housekeeping was terrible. Had to call twice to get clean towels and room cleaned. The first time they brought towels and that was it. They finally cleaned our room on the last day after my second call
"The room was below par. The bathroom tiles are very slippery when wet and I slipped and fell. If you plan on eating or doing other thing in the hotel, plan on spending a lot of money. It is very expensive"
Time to actually renovate the rooms. You advertise that the rooms are renovated. They haven’t been touched in decades. Elevators are in terrible shape. Lucky they actually worked. It’s time to take some of that MGM Vegas money and upgrade.
"Here's a quick list of things that went wrong:

- Elevators were regularly down
- There's no elevator near the Uber area for wheelchairs to use
- The dark and musky environment got old fast
- The TV is as old as the pyramid, very poor quality
- No one was willing to help us on the floor when trying to use the slots
- The two men at the cashier were very rude
- THE WIFI WAS DOWN for a large part of the trip, which made working remote impossible 

And so on...

The best part about staying here was the bellman who helped us check out... not just because he was actually pleasant and very accommodating, but because he was helping us escape this hell hole."
"Room was filthy, and elevator covered in vomit. Previous guest left drugs in nightstand. Best part was “ what do you expect? This is Vegas” 
Place is on par with a trailer park. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a nicer place."
"The room was okay as far as a cheap room goes, cleanliness was okay.  However, I received an email saying I could have an ""upgrade"" for $2.00 more per night.  I chose that.  I have NO idea what could have been upgraded.  The rooms view was a view of a sidewalk to the front of the actual hotel, filthy with trash."
"It was a great stay and great birthday party at Diablo Cantina. My granddaughter turned 21. So we ate, drank, and had a great celebration. This is the first time my granddaughter stayed at the Luxor and she loved it!!"
"The ""upgraded"" room we got was so old and run down.  Wall paper was peeling, the room was smelly and stuffy, there was no microwave, there was no coffee maker/coffee, there were no cups or glasses in the room, the room was big but there was only ONE chair which makes no sense of how you used the room space, and why was the hot tub by the beds instead of in the sitting room area where there was NO furniture. Overall, a horrible design and a horrible room"
"Luxor has wholly lost its former glory, starting from black glass exterior covered in years of dirt to the dirty/stained carpet on the inside.  Smoking of the first level makes it hard to breath.Rooms offer just the bare minimum: no coffee or tea, water, or even hair conditioner is not offered. Stail air coming from the outdated air conditioners in the room offered a constant opportunity for a headache. At over $300 per night, the hotel is at the point of no return for me."
"Just the overall condition of the hotel casino has fallen off in the last few years.  The ""pot"" smell and cigarette smell and filthy musty smell can be overwhelming.  The overall cleanliness is bad.  The street people who wondering in and out of casino has also increased. We will not be staying at Luxor anytime soon. We have been staying there for the past 5 years until now."
"Rooms are remodeled, very comfortable and clean. The elevators are a bit on the older side that would be my only complain. But other than that rooms are really good. Definitely better than what you’re paying for."
I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. The first signed is when I got there to the hotel I arrived around 1am. The rep put in the note when I first booked. I get there and we are tired just to be told our room was given to someone else and it was booked. I had already paid my deposit and upgraded to suite in a tour. The rep gave us a room in the hotel we previous booked but upgraded from. I called the next morning just to be moved to a new room and it was filthy. I took pictures of how nasty and dirty the place was. I am still thinking about posting the pictures so others could be aware.
"Room was clean and comfortable, the pool was  not functioning.  Overall my stay was great, I was given a complementary parking pass, I was happy to have this.  I wish it included complementary breakfast."
"Luxor
We left our house at 04:30am the day of arrival. The front desk was awesome and put us in room 16317 & 16316. My wife was busy unpacking our bags when the problems began. I used the restroom in 16317 and upon flushing the toilet, it reacted like a bidet shooting water out. Standing there confused and dumbfounded, I flushed the toilet again. The toilet again acted like a bidet shooting water out. I told my wife not to touch any plumbing until I had a chance to verify that it worked properly. I opened up every faucet, tub, shower, only to find that all of the plumbing had air in the lines. I was not able to get all of the air out of the toilet in 16317, but it was no longer shooting out like a bidet.

Our next bad Luxor experience came as we went to the Pyramid Cafe. We were seated in a timely manner and received our raspberry tea. 45 minutes later a server showed up and took our order. 20 minutes later the sever handed me the bill and expected me to pay it. Having not even seen the food that we ordered I was a little confused. I paid the bill, and 25 minutes later our food showed up. All of the food was burnt and oddly enough it was cold. Being an insulin dependent diabetic, I did not have the choice to leave and eat someplace else. We managed to eat this garbage that was served to us. The server that brought our raspberry tea stopped by and asked how everything was, to which I replied terrible. I asked to speak with the manager, and she said that she would send her over. 25 minutes later the server that took our order stopped by and asked how everything was, to which I replied awful. I asked him to speak with the manager and he said he would send her over. A few minutes later he returned and said the manager had a personal emergency and had to leave. He handed me two generic business cards with the Luxor main phone number and said that I could call the manager tomorrow. The managers name was nowhere on either of these business cards which really confused me. 

My wife got us dinner from the Back Stage Deli, which we ate in the room. It was very good, and finally put a positive spin on a bad overall day.

Day 2 started with the Luxor breakfast buffet. That meal was so bad it should have been criminal. Scrambled eggs tasted like dirt. Fried potatoes were cold and not fully cooked. Bacon had more grease than an oil lube facility. Fresh fruit could have possibly been recovered from another casinos trash. Biscuits and gravy made me want to cry. Biscuits were harder than rocks, and gravy had less flavor than an old folks home.

We opted for the Tender Steakhouse for dinner in fear of another crappy meal elsewhere. The food was edible, but not overly great. 

Going back to the room looking something positive on the day. My wife turned on the lamp on her side of the bed. It was blinking and shorting out. At this point my wife was very upset because of how bad this trip was going. I told her it was late and I would get the electrically unsafe lamp taken care of in the morning.

Day 3 started with us stopping by the VIP lounge. We told them about our electrically unsafe lamp. They apologized and said they would get housekeeping to take care of it.

We left the Luxor property to be able to get a decent edible meal. Upon returning to our room 16317, my wife had a severe anxiety attack. Come to find out, housekeeping took the electrically unsafe lamp and put it on my side of the bed. When I was able to calm my wife down, I called housekeeping my self. I explained the situation and their failure to fix the problem. They sent a couple of guys up with a replacement lamp. Neither one wanted to plug this bad lamp in and test it.

My Son arrived late and we treated him to the Back Stage Deli. They did not disappoint, the food was great again.

Day 4 We had planned to take in a show and came back to the room 16317 to rest up before the Show. My son said that the floor is wet and his socks were soaked. I said that’s not possible, you only walked from 16316 through the combining door in to 16317 and there is no water source. Wrong, behind the combining doors was an A/C unit leaking water. I called housekeeping and they sent up a couple of guys. The guys both felt the floor and agreed, “yep the carpet is wet”. They sent up a guy from engineering, who felt the carpet and said “the carpet is wet”. We left and went to our Show and had a great time down at Planet Hollywood. Came back to the room and the engineer had turned that one A/C unit down to 60 degrees which did not solve the water leaking problem. My wife broke down and cried.

Drink Service on the gaming floor was literally non existent. We found a table games manager who put us in contact with Miranda the drink service manager. She brought us a couple of drinks roughly 45 minutes later. Oddly we had tracked down a wonderful drink server named Stacy who had already brought us drinks.

The loss of wifi and water our last night did not effect us very much. We had already learned that Dining, Gaming, and Drink Service was better any place outside of the Luxor.

In good conscience the only things that we can recommend at the Luxor is the Back Stage Deli, the Titanic exhibit, King Tut exhibit and the Bodies exhibit. In our opinion everything else at the Luxor is a waste of time and money.

David Okert"
"If you want to have breathtaking views, and exceptional experiences, the Luxor hotel & casino is the place to go!  The aurora bar in the lobby was my go to for a night cap, wonderful atmosphere!  Will definitely come back!"
"This place has gone downhill over the past 10 years. It’s dirty. The walls in the elevators are disgusting. Our bathroom was gross and dated. Shower had a cracked floor, tile was cracked, no make up mirror, barely any toiletries provided. You definitely get what you pay for. The floor in our hallway was soaking wet from a leak and all they did was place a fan there. No one was fixing it for 3 days. The place is going downhill fast. It’s a shame."
Stayed here for bday celebration. Stayed in accessible room in east tower . Bed comfortable and room nice and clean. Only negative I wish there was a microwave in room for later use . Food can be expensive and you might want to save for later. Overall nice hotel .
Everyone was very helpful. Everything was very clean and you can tell the worked very hard to keep it that way.  The person on the front desk worked with us to get all of us on the same same floor and baggage people weee every helpful to store our luggage because we got there too early and they stored our luggage again the day we left .
Casino was clean but rooms need a lot of help the refrigerator needs to be back in rooms also so the 5 to 6 dollar soda does not get warm and have to be thrown away the vents in the rooms need changes
Hotel was very nice. Diablos was very delicious. We had the brunch Buffett and that was the only disappointmet. Food all seemed frozen then just heated  up. Buffet was huge but most of the food repeated through the sections. Only thing I really liked was the mini donuts and some of the pastries. Not worth $40 a person.
"Great stay, friendly staff, great location. Attached to mandalay bay and Excalibur hotel, makes it very easy to get around. The building itself is very cool with all the Egyptian statues. And staying in a pyramid is very fun!"
"This hotel is quite dated, smells of sewer and stale cigarette immediately when you walk in.  The rooms are nasty and the rugs as so gross!  Very disappointing at best! I wouldn’t recommend this “hotel” to anyone!"
"Worst hotel experience of my life, was wasn’t clean at all, house keeping very rude. We left out for the night, when we came back our hotel door was open and held open with a piece of paper. Will never stay here again"
"I’m very happy to stay Luxer. It’s so much clean, nice, fast and friendly service. Eveery where is so much convenience. Sartbucks Coffee, other nice restaurant and bar. Prices so affordable. Very happy to stay. See you next time."
"The room was large and spacious, clean. Housekeeping was in and out quickly every day. Plenty of towels. Amazing hot water with good water pressure. Could not hear our neighbors. The way the elevator system works and each small area of the floor works makes it so that people from other areas of the hotel casino cannot get to your area without a key card. So very little foot traffic in front of our room"
"Average stay. Definitely worth the low price being an older hotel and at the end of the stop. No reception on cellphones in part of the hotel and in our room. Lack of solution when brought up the issue at the front desk. Room was nice, wish there were more restaurants"
Great stay over all for the price. Enjoyed the exhibits and shows at the hotel which was convenient. Rooms are a little dated but worked well for the days we were there. Buffet left a lot to be desired but the rest of the food onsite was good. Especially Tender Steakhouse but be prepared to pay a PRETTY penny!
"They give me discounted room rates, even though I don't play much at MGM casinos. They also gave me a $50 food and beverage credit, but no one told me until the end of my trip, so I didn't get to use it. I used the mobile app to check-in, which is very convenient, but I was told that's why no one told me about the $50 credit. If I would have checked in at the desk, they supposedly would have told me. Maybe they should told me by email or in the app. 
The limits in the casino are just as high as the other MGM casinos on the strip. You have to max bet on the slots to be eligible for bonuses and blackjack only plays 6-5 at $25 limit tables. Craps with a $25 min table limits is also really high. With a $25 minimum on craps, you can easily have $100's bet on each roll. Because of these high limits, I can't help but Uber over to Ellis or even walk to the Oyo. 
Overall, I'd recommend staying at the Luxor. They are conveniently located near the airport and getting around the strip is easy from their location. You can take the free tram to Excalibur, walk to the monorail across the street at MGM or take the cheap, double-decker city bus, ""Deuce"", down the strip and to Downtown."
Very close to everything you need shuttle and tram service on point staff was on point food was pricey but the quality was worth it rooms were clean and dead were comfortable the choice between shower and soaking it up in jetted tub was a bonus
The only issue I had with my room was that someone took my charger pice for my charger and also there was not a thicker comforter to use. I am from NY and I would have like a thicker comforter for the night.
Work affairs thanks need more people working and breakfast in the morning more business no refresh event in the front desk hope next time wait on the line for check in will be very fast customer service number one
"The place was magnificent. I have never been to Vegas before but I surely will be back. The staff was friendly, the food was good everywhere I ate, my room was clean, and the casino was fun. They seem like they go above and beyond."
Rent an air b and b you’ll be better off and more comfortable! I don’t even recall a menu for room service (if there is room service) there was no fridge nor microwave! First time to Vegas and this place wasn’t it!!!
The rooms are dirty. The plugs don’t work. The fixtures are covered in dust. The lamp shades are not even screwed on. Tile broken in the bathroom and or missing. Tub was dirty. Rooms need a lot of attention.
"Staff at the front desk were not helpful at all. We had booked a massage at the spa , we called to see the options, but the stuff at the SPA couldn’t wait to hang up on us. We paid for two days of parking and we were told we could use a room key to exit the parking., But it never worked eventhough we went to front desk 2 times reporting the problem. Every time we had to ring the bell at the parking gate and wait  for somebody to answer and  open the gate. We paid to have a late check out at 3:00, we came back to our room at 1 o’clock, and the cleaning people were cleaning the room for the next guest. I wouldn’t stay there again , I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
"Great staff, rooms are great size but fridge and coffee machine would be nice. Far from strip but easy bus access if willing to hop on and off. Lots to do within the hotel. Titanic was beyond amazing. The Diablo's Cantina has the best staff and food"
The hotel and casino smelled of smoke a lot more then other hotels that we visited. Several lights were broken or hanging out of the ceiling. The iron didn’t work properly and was leaking water everywhere when you tried to use it. Also the shower was very hard to change the temperature when showering. The staff was nice and the spa was very enjoyable.
"Great customer service, rooms clean , love the updated rooms , my room was ready at 10 am. And that was without paying for a early check in ,  I would strongly recommend the Luxor to everyone. Hasn’t let me down yet …"
Stayed in the premium king size room in the Pyramid. Very large and spacious room. Wish they had a coffee maker in the room. Overall it was a nice hotel with plenty of eating options on the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay sides. Best Mexican place was on the Mandalay Bay side. Ate there 2 nights in a row.
"Rooms were basic, no slippers provided in room so bring your own (feet hurt after long hours of walking and then having to stand on tiles to get ready) beds were comfy stayed in the tower. Overall not bad just not as fancy as the other hotels but good value for your dollar"
Very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful when we had questions. Cocktail waitress was quick and friendly. Exhibits were cool and food was very delicious. Easy access to neighboring hotels. MGM is great.
Thought luxor was a luxury hotel several years back and noticed they were cheaper this time around. Was not aware they had resort fees that added up to 120 bucks additional. Water stunk and even staff joked how bad the elevators were. Lots of entertainment near or in which was good but they need to cut resort fees and redo some things. Room was needinf update. Bathrooms looked modern enough but tub and cealing leaked
"Like I said the room was so poor the carpet looked dirty
We tried to buy a movie and screen says low signal
Tv reception was horrible 
No fridge for our leftover foods
And our curiosity extended check out was not honored after the lady said we can leave at 12pm"
The experience at Luxor is okay. America's Got Talent was the best part. The worst part was when the security officers laughed at my concern for someone trying to sell drugs. These words are to go over the 200 minimum.
"The stay was great. We attended for ProBowl. The restaurants had good portions and the drinks were wonderful. Everything was good, the service could’ve been a little better and a microwave would’ve been nice."
"The hotel was a little out dated, but it was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Bed was comfy, good sized room. We ate at 3 of the resturants, the food was good and staff friendly.  A great place to stay for my first time in Vegas!!"
"Rooms were dusty and in our room, there was crumbling ceiling from what appeared to be a water leak of some sort. Trash was left behind the dresser and in the garbage can upon check in. Then when we chose to NOT have the room serviced while we were there, they came in anyway and made the bed and tool the do not disturb sign off our door. Friendly staff, just old and dirty rooms."
The Luxor is in a great location if you're going to Allegiant Stadium it's in walking distance approximately 10-15 minutes. The room was clean but the beds were not comfortable however the entertainment there is fabulous cause it's an MGM property and you're connected with all of the latest shows and activities fabulous restaurants.
Tower room away from the busy part of the strip allowed for quality sleep. Lovely soaking tub. Walk way to fun bars at Mandalay Bay was convenient. Resort fee charge for no resort benefit was a downer. Overall prices of drinks unbelievable! Not the Vegas I remember at 21.
"No water upon arrival, No one willing to be honest or help. Would only come clean the room when they pleased - even though we could only get them to come two times in a 6 day stay. Room that was promised was not received and lets not forget prior to arrival they kept ""losing"" my reservation. Wouldn't recommend this MGM Property, Stay at the Aria its the place to be"
"Absolutely disgusting rooms, not clean at all! 
Staff was ok
Floors not clean at all, carpets gross, hair from previous people all over. The only thing that semi worked was the AC unit. If anyone in the hallways wisher you will hear it at all times of the day."
"Location is good 
Hotel is old an not up dated even the elevator is in rough condition 
Used to be a nicer hotel  not taken care of 
Quality did not exist from the bedsheets to the toiletries, sad to see this place so run down
Location I’d good"
This experience was the best ever. I love the room and staff. They food was amazing and free champagne. The walk was a little far but it was easy to find. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends.
"Every moment from check in to check out was spot on!!!! Restraunts, gaming, shows ...we did it all!! Great family time . ALL AGES!!! THANK YOU HOUSEKEEPING!! THANK YOU ALL!!! THX HOST OTT!!! Can't wait to get back to Vegas!!!"
"Great Service by Great People.
Right after the reopening the resort was kind of dusty but understandable, we stay at Luxor at least every 2 months, now looks cleaner and organized,
Thank you Luxor for your hospitality,"
"Food court was 30 minutes late opening up and service was rude , all together its a little out dated , and the people behind the desk are absolutely clueless on what's going on..never got a call from them when room was ready and also had my father's name mixed up with mine just a mess"
"A great place to stay, gamble & eat!!! Would definitely return here!!! I wish there were refrigerators in the room but overall very comfortable except for my mattress! The location is perfect for me ! Close to everything!!!"
"The Luxor is just fine if you’re going to Las Vegas. It’s at the South end, so a hike to the majority of the other places on the strip. There is a tram that connects it to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. The food options are fine, but nothing special. The slot and table options are fine (limits aren’t as low as what you can find nearby at The Trop). The room was clean and had the basics. The in-room safe feature is convenient in the bedside table. The staff are polite, if not necessarily friendly/welcoming. The mobile app was easy to use for checking in and out. The elevators have seen better days. Their incline keeps them from moving fast, but they eventually get you there. As an overall option, it’s nothing special, but it does the job."
"Nothing is new in the hotel. The theme is good and nice, but the hotel lacks everything. Rooms were dusty, we had a suite with a spa, but it was a hepatitis spa in actuality since it was never disinfected…"
"Cleanliness and careful care of the room is very sub par. Ensure upon check in you thoroughly look at your room. I had hair from previous guest in my sheets, pillows, the shower had hair and the shower drain flooded the bathroom. The guest service rapport lacks and it so many guest that it is difficult for them to really care forr your concerns. I do not recommend this hotel."
Plenty of better options that don’t charge hidden fees for amenities that are closed. Elevators were only semi-operable and room keys were finicky trying to get on the elevator. Cool place to stay though.
"Easy access from parking garage to front desk to elevator to room
Love the backstage  Deli
Just relaxed in room for a two night stay
Centrally located by the main strip 
Enjoyed our time
Would recommend"
"Our room was clean. The maid nust have knocked the plug out of the t.v so a staff member had to come up and find the issue.
Our shower would not drain properly. So we had to wait an hour between showers. Our pillows were hard and probably old. Overall not a big deal and we were just fine."
Great pillows  great staff   Clean check in line was very long  had fun Will recommend to friends elavator could use some service all around great time I will visit again send coupons and tram system was awesome
"Rude check in staff, will tell you extended check out but wont follow through. You’ll be treated poorly if you don’t look “rich” (after staying I have no idea why anyone rich would even stay there).  The rooms say “upgraded” but are subpar. Yes it’s cheap to stay but there are many other hotels def worth the small extra price. The casino has an extremely weird vibe and the machines are SO cold."
Room was nice and clean most of the staff was very friendly and we were helped quickly with our toilet not flushing and accommodated for the problem without asking for anything we received 100 in credit to use towards food or drinks
"Silvia at the front desk was awesome, the room was spacious, very quiet and very clean.  Breakfast at the pyramid cafe was great everyday and the staff at the cafe were great, kept the coffee flowing, in fact all staff were great"
"Outdated rooms, no usb ports, no microwave & no refrigerator. Room was clean but furniture was old. The lobby & casino areas were nice. This casino was on my bucket list for years, however the room brought me down. I didn't have wifi access for 1 night"
No Clock radio in the room    Ceilings are outdated with acoustic spray texture.  Toilets were mini.  Beds were good however.  Very noisy when trying to sleep. Staff is okay very helpful when asking for directions
The location was perfect for Mandalay Convention.  Terrific value and very comfortable accommodations.  Easy access to the Vegas strip and all of the best restaurants and shows in the area. Would recommend the Luxor and will plan on staying again when I return.
They did not fix cooling/heating issues. Called a number of times to front desk. They sent techs out and still couldn’t fix. So we had no sleep due to the climate in the room. They did not offer any accommodations or to relocate room. I will not stay there ever again.
This property needs a gut renovation. It is tired and old and the wifi doesn't work properly. They should just get going and fix it. One of the members of our group stepped on a cockroqch in their bathroom
"All was good until we went to Bucca's. Food was terrible for the family. Service was bad, they where under staffed. I've been in culinary 30+ years and you need to take better care of your guest. It took 30 minutes to get a drink. We always will come back, but fix the problems!!"
"This room was disgusting, old, mold in shower. I had no running water for hours. No notice at all that the water will be shot down. This was the worst hotel room by far. I wouldn’t let my dog stay in a room like that."
"Was in a king spa suite and Room need work, and elevators take forever to get you to your room looks like no one has worked on them in years. Wanted to play pai gow and let it ride, I had to either walk to another casino or take a taxi to another casino."
Nice room and decent location but bathroom tub was dirty and had hair in it. Friendly staff and quick check in. wouldn’t mind staying again just needs to be cleaned up a little better before hand. Over all 8/10.
"We stayed in room 4128 Pyramid View King room. Our room was cleaned daily. The bed was comfortable, but did have the appearance of the high quality air mattress as it sat relatively close to the floor. The shower pressure was more than sufficient. 

We downloaded the MGM app so we avoided the front desk check-in process. A lot of the restaurants (within the hotel) closed early 10-11pm so you will likely have dine while out in the city. The food court was open later than the other restaurants, but not many options. 

The only horrendous part was the smell of the elevators! Smells like the toilet drains are affixed to the outside elevator (sarcasm).

If you have time and want a couple of free perks the downstairs attendants and casino associates will bombard you every time you walk by for a timeshare presentation. We attended the one for Wyndham and the presentation was at a Wyndham location.

You will be rushed into making a decision, but whichever presentation you attend use a moment to google reviews and search for Facebook groups of other owner experiences of that particular “timeshare” before making a decision on purchasing.

If you’re indecisive about purchasing be sure to ask about cancellation if you decide to buy and have buyers remorse! 

This hotel was away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but still within walking distance. I was under the impression that there would be scenic views, but there wasn’t.

Once I return I would likely stay elsewhere to get the full Vegas vibe. Nothing against Luxor, but I prefer to be where there’s action :-)"
"Be aware that the Luxor does not have coffee makers, refrigerators or decent blankets in the room. They force you to go downstairs (after waiting for elevator for a long time) in your pajamas and morning face to wait in line at Starbucks to spend an exorbitant amount of money for a quick pick me up drink. There was also no maid for the entire weekend we were there"
"Great time with kids! We came for the pro bowl and we were able to walk to the stadium. Saved money with walking there. Staff was very friendly, and great help finding things. Blue man was fantastic and the BEST dinner at Diablos cantina."
"I was hesitant to book based on some of the bad reviews, but it was all fine.  Room 7202 was nice, clean, but a little dark but that is the theme of the whole place. Was a slight smokey smell (the room was non-smoking) but dissipated once we were settled in the room (or we just got used to it?) There was a constant hum from something mechanical, like the air system (?), that never shut off, as a light sleeper it was annoying. Had a nice view to the west out our window. Bathroom was nice and clean as well.  Could have used some hair conditioner to go with the shampoo, yes I could have asked, but was on a tight schedule so I didn't want to bother with it. Most annoying thing was the digital key through the app. Even though I had it all set up ahead of time, each time I went to use the elevator/get in the room, it asked me to re-verify my identity, which isn't the easiest thing to do. Go for the key card, probably way easier.  All in all a good stay, lots to see, eat, drink and do throughout the hotel."
"I reserved a two bed room for four of us. By the time we got there, someone had given our room to other guests. The staff member was apologetic but we were forced to sleep in a one king bed room with the promise of an upgrade for the second night. What we got for the second night was the two queen bed suite. Yep, that’s the room I originally reserved. We were also promised room credit in the amount of $150. No credit showed on the final bill. I paid for parking with all the room charges only to find out that I had to pay again when we were leaving. $92 for parking for two days. All of this adds up to almost criminal neglect of Luxor customers. Will absolutely never go back here."
"Horrible hotel.  Out-dated rooms.  No cable.  Hard towels. Uncomfortable bed and pillows.  No microwave, mini fridge or even coffee maker.  No USB outlets for electronics.  I felt as if I was  back in the 80s."
"Luxor has very friendly staff members. Unfortunately, there are non guest trying to enter the floors. Management needs to start paying more attention. Buffet was okay. I am vegan so very limited choices, however they had nice veggies...not sure if I return for a buffet as it's a bit pricey for few veggies."
This was our kid’s trip to Vegas. They had such a wonderful trip. They loved the aesthetic of the hotel and had so much fun with all of the exhibits. I will be using my MGM rewards to book another trip soon.
The value and cleanliness of the rooms & MGM's military benefits are awesome. I was impressed by the upgrade to Pearl status from being a military retiree/veteran. Layout of the Luxor is easy to navigate & food choices are good. I have been to Vegas many times but now MGM stands out & I will look forward to coming back.
"The updated rooms in the pyramid were great!  The place was clean and very nice!  Also, loved gambling there and the live music!  Location on strip was right where we wanted to be.  Will definitely return!!"
"This was my 1st time staying at the Luxor Premium Towers, would definitely stay again and highly recommend it. Close to the MGM, NYNY, Mandalay Bay, Delano and Excalibur hotels. The staff was friendly and courteous. If you want a hotel close to the Allegiant stadium this is the place.."
This stay was great.  The Luxor had many amenities where you don't have to leave your hotel.  Great restaurants and activities.  The property was phenomenal.  It was close by to mostly everything on the strip and the major attractions. Highly recommend!
"Stayed at the Luxor for the Builders Show.  The hotel was clean and had good service.  Check in had a little issue, however, I was able to resolve it in a timely fashion.  Buffet was closed due to a grease line problem."
"Terribly outdated rooms. Very poor housekeeping. No hot water, only mildly warm. Aggressive prostitutes and drug dealers on the casino floor. Price gouging in full effect. Switched to a nicer Caesar's property for half the cost"
"This hotel will nickel and dime you to death, provide mediocre service and accommodations. Make the most of your Vegas experience and stay in a much better hotel, you will thank me later!!!! I recommend moving further down the strip so you can more easily walk to other attractions and venues and not have to rely so much on cabs."
"If cigarette smoke doesn’t bother you, The hotel would be fine.. First room I was given (10th floor)  I had to change because either someone was smoking on the floor in the rooms next to me  or the smoke coming from the casino traveled up onto the floor and into the room was burning my eyes and nose and I couldnt sleep. They changed my room to the 4th floor behind the elevator and it was better regarding cigarette smoke, but for the price I paid per night for the room, the room was not worth it."
"Let’s begin with a positive. Quick and friendly checkin when we arrived. Luxor resort not as clean as we experienced at other casinos we visited on our stay. Main issue was the parking. Paid for parking with understanding that it would be good for other MGM resorts throughout our stay. Yes we could park at other resorts but key never worked for entire trip to enter or exit any of the parking areas, not even the Luxor that we were paying guests. We wasted a lot of time trying to rectify the situation with the front desk. However, not even the manager that we spoke with helped to fix the problem. I had to continually share my name and room number in the public parking areas for all to hear. Some people may say big deal to that, but a past experience with a beak in to a hotel room was blamed on us sharing our name and room number publically(not at this resort). Unfortunately, this makes me very uncomfortable having to share this info again and again. Of course the manager, believe her name was spelled Ashlee at the Luxor, acted as if this parking issue was not a big deal. After we had our keyed changed several times we gave up. We were tired of eating our time.  We have had a lot of success at other resorts in Las Vegas, so I guess the Luxor (and other MGM resorts must not want our business)."
"Ive traveled to Las Vegas many times and loved staying at Luxor, but its been years since I last visited and our room was pretty low quality with a missing mini fridge, flickering lights and some lights that didn’t even work. I don’t remember the quality of the rooms being that bad. A bit disappointing but the food, especially at the Diablo’s Cantina was still as amazing as I remembered! Great staff managing both the Cantina and the Bar as well!"
Reserved a room in the pyramid with a shower chair they no longer have shower chairs only handicapped rooms in the tower and I was switched and upon arrival I could not get my room back that I originally reserved because it was given away and I was stuck in the tower and the bed was extremely uncomfortable inside of that Tower was a very long walk I had to rent a scooter for mobility accessible because it was such a far walk
"I had wanted to stay at Luxor for many years. Finally made it to vegas and got a midweek deal at a great price. 
The restaurants were excellent,  seeral great shows to choose from. The enclosed shopping arcades between the hotels are really fun to wxplore too. 
Thebest part was the room. The angled walls are super cool and give fantastic views. Just outside your door a balcony overlooks the interior of the hotal. Large rooms with great bathrooms, huge safes, comfortable beds and spotlessly clean. 
Highly recommend staying here."
"The Luxor was much better than expected.  We were upgraded to a tower room, which was great.  I loved that it was so easy to get around.  There was easy access to our friends in the resorts close to us. Food was good and the rooms clean!"
"A classic hotel, but needs some TLC in many areas.  Corporate needs to put some money into this property in many areas to make it look presentable.  Rooms, elevators, lobby, halls, casino, common areas need to be fixed or updated."
"You get what you pay for. I think MGM is tearing this place down soon, so beware elevators will take a while since half of them are broken. Room was very dusty. It was a decent price, which is why I stayed here, but I will try another place next time. Water pressure in the bathroom was solid, but at the $30/day spa it was pretty weak in the shower and below expectations."
"Horrible room smells like dead animals.  Try to give me different room even worse,  food smells.  I would not recommend stay here.  I checked in and went back to front desk explain them situation.  They offer me different room after speaking with management.  However room was worse than where I was. They came and spray air fresheners stilll smells in hallway and room."
"The hotel was substandard. Our bathroom sink was clogged the entire time, no amenities, we had to rent a refrigerator if we wanted one. Not even a glass to use. The elevator barely closed completely and looked all beat up, railings in hallways were missing chunks from them. Someone was climbing from a rope outside our window. The hallway was slanted like it might collapse. The diner was closed the entire time. Construction was going on below our room and not disclosed beforehand. Trash bags left on my clothes in my suitcase!"
Great hotel but the cleanliness of the hotel bathrooms are horrible. Even the housekeeper said the bathroom wasn’t cleaned right. I’ll stay again no problem next time. I love the hotel and how beautiful it is.
"I stayed for a layover. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and spacious, and the location was very good and close to the airport. The price was excellent! It was a bargain. I would stay there again."
Never again it was terrible. There was a horrible smell coming from the sink. I couldn’t sleep due to the smell and there was also a leak in the room. My shower was out dated. I was very unhappy with my stay.
Got ripped off by my family friend that booked the same room same day got for $99 but the time we were done it cost me almost $400 WTF bed sucked no fitted sheets only flat sheets so they were all tangled up all night shower door was rotting on the bottom it just sucked all around
Hotel was ok but the room did not have a refrigerator looks like they removed it from the room. Bed was comfortable overall it is a good clean place to stay. The casino floor is very mellow I’m pretty sure it’s due to the location of the hotel being at the beginning of the strip.
Room was not clean. There was a very large amount of hair the size of a cantalope left in the bathroom waste container. We did not have water during our second night there.  Carrot Top show was cancelled.
Same mediocre experience. Customer service is horrible and rewards offers aren’t that great. I will and stay somewhere else next time. The rewards program is not near as good as it sounds. We always have a big group and they aren’t accommodating at all in trying to get rooms close together.
This was a nice first Vegas experience. I wish you had a bit different games for tables but you had a bunch of nice ones nonetheless. I liked the Luxor interior and the design. The staff was friendly and welcoming.
After a long day of fun you want a clean place to rest. Dirty sheets affected the trip. There was a second bed that I ended up sleeping on but I wasn't comfortable going in the sheets. I try not to be a bother but I'll probably call for new sheets next time.
My first time staying at the Luxor and it was very pleasant. Rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. There is lots to do and eat right at the resort and close by. Connecting indoor breezeways let you travel to other hotels as well without going outside. Very convenient location to experience everything on the strip.
"One elevator... Room in the other corner. So much walking just to go get coffee. So much walking to get anywhere in the luxor do not recommend. Food expensive, pain to get anywhere. Would give it 2 starts"
Don't get the jacuzzi room at the luxor cause you may check in to a public hair and sperm infested tub. The rooms are dirty and the walk from self parking is to long to check in. The manager is useless
I loved the hotel as it was very unique. The shows were okay. My biggest issue is the staff didn’t notify me that the water would be shut off from 12-4 and that caused a lot of issues for me and my service dog.
"Poor to terrible service. Different prices for the same room within a conference event that changes daily. I overpaid in a hotel with old rooms, moldy showers etc. I would expect more from an organization like this. The Luxor is borderline dive."
First time staying here as we just wanted a much needed getaway. Upon arrival the appearance was good overall. The rewards room checkin rep wasn't very pleasant and had no personality. I guess because we got in the wrong line so we were were nobody's to him. After a long wait in line for checkin in we get to the room and it clearly states non smoking however it smelled like someone had just lit up prior to us walking in. The room was average and the bed was trash! So uncomfortable. We had a tower room. Casino was decent as far as layout and the location was as well. Doubt that we would choose to stay here again. Definitely a one and done but to each their own.
Only complaint is there are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms. Not having a refrigerator in the room or a microwave. Made it hard to put the leftover food to save for later. Also the in room dining in early even on the weekend.
"We had a great experience with all phases of the Luxor! From the moment we checked in at the front desk, throughout our 6 days, and at check out, everyone was so kind and courtious. Rooms were clean and well kept. (and our bed and pillows were very comfortable) We didn't have any noise issues. (and I'm a light sleeper) The casino had a good vibe to it. The shops were very helpful. And the restaurants were good!"
Very disappointing to find out there’s no security cameras to record the thieves the broke into my room and stole medicine bags and shoes my first time staying there and last especially when you have kids
Loved my stay at the Luxor. The rooms are clean and comfortable and there is everything you need for an enjoyable stay. It also smelled wonderful when you walk through the front doors. And the turkey club at the Backstage Deli was fantastic.
"We upgraded to a suite and it was a very old room (80s furniture), smelled like weed, I had to rewash all my clothes after I came home. Check in process was very long, only 2 people assisting at least 30 guests. They also were not friendly with us."
Hookers and loud music next door to me. Luxor would not help after pleading with them. Kept telling me security would come but they never did.  Walls are paper thin.  Rooms are not great and no coffee maker in rooms.  Poor iron and ironing board.  Never again!
"The lady at the service counter was very rude and short with me. I had to stand line for over 30 minutes before I could check in. The room was gross and not clean and smelled like smoke. The bathroom was not clean. The towels smelled of smoke. I could not tell if they were dirty of just porley washed.  There was not a refrigerator but there was a note where the refrigerator should be saying that you could rent one for 25 dollars a night.  So you pay a resort fee and a refrigerator rental fee on top of that. This place is a joke. The bedding looked as it had already been slept on. Guest serviced never answered when I called about the room smelling like smoke and the room being dirty. Charged for a resort fee when I used nothing on the resort. Checked in after 9pm and left at 4am. How is that fair. I will never tell anyone to stay at the place it was an awful experience. I should have slept in thr Airport. 

I was stuck in a room that smelled of smoke and cigarettes and dirty bedding. The air did not work. No one answered the phone at the front desk. By being so exhausted I was stuck in sleep in a chair what seem to be cleaner than the bed."
"From check in to leaving I had a great time. The luxor was near what I wanted to see and do check in was fast, nice big room, and great things to see and che k out. Played some, games, dra k some adult beverages and ate some good food"
"Hotel is in dire need of maintenance. There are broken tiles, the elevators are dinged, scratched and stained. The furniture in the room looks old and stained. The table in my room looked like it was heavily used for at least 50 years. There was no way to put you shampoo and soap in the shower. Seriously? You have to put in on the shower floor? Even motel 6 has something for you to put you soap and shower. The ink water smelled like sewage, not exaggerating. The food was OK at best and extremely overpriced."
I’d most likely not to book the same one again due to WiFi is so poor and the vent is making noise very bad at night. I don’t believe this should be a 3.5 stars casino standards for their guest. I had mentioned this to front desk personnel
"Overall the property feels a bit tired, and it is extremely confusing to navigate at first.  The food is OK but there are limited options, especially at lunch.  The fitness center was great, but was out of towels on day 2."
Construction vehicles right outside my window  beeping relentlessly at 5 30am;  elevators broken; NO internet service; Total Joke of a stay... and.. waited 18 min for a cab to the airport. Dismal stay all around and the staff just apologized but did nothing.  The stay was not worth FREE... have NO idea why they would not care so much but I'd not ever staybthere again.
The smell of raw sewage permeates different parts of the casino and some elevator shafts. The amenities consisted of 1 shampoo 1lotion and 1 bar of soap. The coupon we booked the room for wasn’t even honored!
"The updated rooms were really nice, The only issue is the check in with digital key. if you lose wifi your digital key no longer works and you have to walk all the way back to the lobby to print a new key"
"My husband, my parents and my infant daughter stayed in 2 rooms one night before a flight last week. Good price and good location, but  water did not work at all, heat did not work (room 55 degrees when we woke up) and staff unfriendly."
"Easy trip for us.  Now that the cab company's offer a flat rate to the strip it was much easier to travel to the hotel.  Didn't have to find the Lyft area, wait for the car, etc...  Hotel check-in was easy.  Only waited maybe for 5 min.  Check-out easy also.  Room very clean and quiet.  Great restaurant/bar choices.  Easy access to hotels Mandalay Bay and Excalibur without going outdoors since it was kind of windy and cool during our stay.  Casino nice and spacious with alot of games to play. Would stay again."
"Second time here for birthday celebrations loved how spacious and clean the rooms are also the convenience of the location only few minutes from the airport, and right on the strip with a stop for the Big Red Bus just across."
"Got here and had to spend weekend in ER due to mold in the room. Got back around 10pm the next day only to have a second reaction after being in the room for just a few minutes. When I called the front desk and told them they did not care and said “well you could leave”. Lmao. Okay so after the ER visit, hospital transfer via ambulance, and SECOND reaction when returning to the hotel—Luxor is a JOKE and the “manager” we spoke to disnt even respond to us just passed us on to a front desk person that asked us what his problem was that night. No one wanted to help us or see the pics of the mold/mildew that nearly caused a death. A near intubation. Let that settle in your brains please because this place  does NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR GUESTS. Absolutely horrible stay and will always recommend people to stay literally anywhere else. I HOPE someone has enough empathy to reach out and attempt to resolve this as even when we tried staying loyal to the MGM brand and moved over to Vdara with absolutely no help from any employees, they also seemed not to care and just wanted the money for a very expensive walk-in room. Tried explaining situation and it being so late and experiencing a horrible time because of Luxor… again, the brand just does not care about their loyal members who try yet agin to have a good time. Just wanted to breathe so we went to the non-smoking hotel. At least we got a free mini bottle of water i guess. Even the Vdara room wasnt clean bro like hair in the sink and tub and something spilled all over the closet door. HORRIBLE."
"The room smelled bad like a musty oder and cigarette smoke that seeps in the room, blood on our pillowcases, dirty sheets. Elevators were in not the greatest shape. Food in at the buffet was horrible to the fact they refunded us our money back as soon as we saw it. Not a great experience for my 1st time."
"We really enjoyed staying at the Luxor Resort. The staff was friendly, price was great, and the resort stayed clean. I would suggest anyone that’s looking for a place to stay in Las Vegas to check out the Luxor. You won’t be sorry."
"I’ve heard many say to not stay at the Luxor. It’s one of the older hotels. Incorrect! For the price you can’t beat it. The hotel is always clean, everyone is willing to help, theming is great. Nothing negative to say, 5th time on the strip, 3rd time at the Luxor."
Good place to stay. Rooms are always clean and if you need anything housekeeping is always there and super friendly. The only bad thing is that their digital key system barely works cause you get far enough in you lose service
"Don’t recommend at all. Great themed hotel ruined by being old and run down. We had an issue on the inclinator (elevator that goes up at 39 degree angle). It abruptly stopped halfway up to our room on the 12th floor causing my wife to fall into me. Room was old, ceiling chipping, bed uncomfortable, old AC system that one would expect to see in a cheap motel. The list goes on and on. The only positive thing was the Starbucks at registration where I could use my mobile app to order a coffee and breakfast. Will never ever go back."
"Bath tub was dirty. One of the rooms smell like poop. Pillow smell like sweat.
Prince is mot bad but for a little more money you can get a better place. I definitely do not recommend you to stay at this place."
"Hotel was in a great location and had lots to do onsite. Friendly staff that was very helpful. Easy access to many other casinos, entertainment and restaurants.  Put your walking shoes, Vegas has lots to see!"
Everything was nice in order the food was great every time I come to Vegas I always stay at the Luxor Hotel I like the friendliness and the different type of foods in the atmosphere you can come and really meet some new people from other cities and counties
Apparently the heat and hot water was not work for one full day and we had no notice the room was ice cold and we had no hot water the maintenance man told yes it was because the plant was out. The hotel didn’t give us notice and when I called they played stupid I asked to change rooms or get a discount NOTHING. I WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN.
"Everything about the hotel was exceptional. My daughter and I had a great time from customer service to spa all the way to maintenence 
Thank you so much, we will definitely come back soon especially for that spa."
Hotel great. Staff values their customers. Every member we came in contact with or observed very friendly.?Many choices to eat and many more with adjoining Excalibur Hotel. The Luxor was very clean in every area. Needs more elevators !
"I upgraded to a room and paid for the upgrade and the room for a wedding to a suite and I checked in the room smell like smoke and mildew
and it had ants crawling around the shower
the upgrade was a waste of money
 then they switch me to another one it had no heat
We had to sleep in the cold for our last night I pay extra for a suite for it to be dirty for both rooms"
"Overall the hotel was filled with good vibes, clean and plenty of entertainment. I did not have to leave the hotel at all. The exhibits, shows, and food court were easily accessible! All of the attractions could be purchased conveniently by a mobile device or box office."
"Checking in at the Luxor was not the best part of the experience for us. We arrived early and wanted to get checked in and request early access to our room. Since we booked through a third party, we used Expedia, the desk was not able to help us. We were told we could self-check in, but that app did not work properly. We went back up to the desk, and she asked her manager to assist, but he couldn't figure it out either. She did say that she would call us when the room became ready, and we went off to drop our luggage at the bell hop desk.  We didn't have to wait long, because she called us at 10:30 to say we could pick up our room key at the desk. We were in our room by 11 am, which was awesome since check-in isn't normally until 3 pm. The room itself was clean, but sort of felt ""tired."" Underneath the air conditioner/heater was bare concrete, and the cabinet that normally housed the small in-room refrigerator was just a big empty space with a cord hanging inside it. The bathroom was clean, the shower was also clean and all fixtures seemed in good condition. The toilet seat did not stay up when raised and was so low that it was difficult to get up from seated position. They only supplied 1 small bar of soap, which required us to transfer it back and forth repeatedly from sink to  shower. Otherwise, the people we encountered, from the desk staff to the bellhop, to all the workers in the casino and food or shops, all seemed pleasant and helpful. The drinks at the Cetra lounge were great as well as reasonably priced. The cocktail server treated us very well. The food we had operated by the Luxor, from the buffet, the Pyramid Cafe, and the Backstage Deli, all were surprisingly good-well prepared. The pricing for most of the food options here were pricey by normal standards, but by Vegas Strip standards, not too bad. The convenience made it worthwhile. We also saw the America's Got Talent show in the Luxor theater and enjoyed it quite a bit. Even if you're not a fan of the show, it would be a worthwhile experience as well. Signage to find your way on the cassino floor could be better, but they do have employees available to help direct you if needed. We really liked having a designated Uber pick-up/drop-off location, taking the guesswork out of where to schedule your ride to get you around Vegas. The ckeck-out process is made simple with a key drop box at the elevators, and you simply scan a QR code and let them know you're checking out. We stayed in the Pyramid part of the original hotel, but did not see the newer tower rooms, so couldn't speak to any comparisons between the two. The online info we saw stated that they had not made any updates to the rooms in the Pyramid part, and we could not find any info stating when this may take place. Still, we thoroughly enjoyed the Luxor overall and would not find it difficult to choose to stay there again."
"Pros: location.

Cons: far walk from elevator to room. Bathroom had mold and a crumbling bathroom door. Housekeeping didn’t clean or restock our room for 3 days. Timeshare type sales people bombarded us as soon as we tried to approach the check in desk and delayed our check in with their slimmy sales pitch when all we wanted to do after a long flight was check in and go to our room. lacked the food options of those hotels around it."
"All the doors face the interior of the casino, so it was very loud BUT, I figured out that by turning the fan on for the htg/ac unit, that solved the problem. The rooms, bed, pillows, sheets were great!"
"Quick get away for hubby and I, 2 nights. We took SWA up on their vacation deal. We usually stay at the Bellagio or Aria. This one is less expensive and you get what you pay for! Noisy rooms! :( 
 The Mexican rest. is good. We saw the AGT Allstars show and that was a waste of $.   We saw the Bodies exhibit and enjoyed that. Casino was decent.  We will try a different hotel next time."
"We had a wonderful time at the Luxor. The room was spacious being larger than the average hotel room.  Our room had an adjoining door.  That was the only downside as we could hear our next door neighbor’s conversations. I’m sure the door was the sole reason for
hearing him. If you stay at the Luxor request a room without an adjoining door."
"Falsely advertised, incredibly rundown, so many safety issues.  Key readers at elevators malfunctioned, trapped inside of elevators many times during stay.  No maintenance or house keeping done on the property.  Peoples throw up left on elevators and hallways.  So many other safety violations that I don’t have enough time and space to write.   Horrible place."
The room I had was dated.  I think there were undated rooms but it was not offered at checkin. It's nice that the resorts had linked hallways so you didn't have to go outside to get to the next resort.
"We had got a non-smoking room and upon entering it was apparent the previous person smoked in the room. Then we got locked out of our rooms and had to pay once more for another night. Not only that but there are buttons missing in the elevators, the area is rundown. It’s an overpriced motel on the strip."
Staff at checkin and checkout are cold and unwelcoming. When you ask questions they act like you are bothering them. HVAC in our room was never fixed or the smell was never investigated and housekeeping never once cleaned our room in the 5 days we were there. Save your money and stay at the Excalibur. The staff are way more friendly and so helpful
"Stayed over Super Bowl weekend.  Found a bum sleeping in the tunnel leading to the parking garage.  Elevators were in very bad shape. Giant Americas got Talent sign on the front of the pyramid blocks view for almost all rooms.  Price is not a bargain once the resort fee is added.  Excalibur next door is also owned by MGM, is cheaper and in my opinion better quality.  Some cocktail waitresses were very inattentive completely ignoring customers who ask for a drink.  TV in room goes on volume 30 every time it is turned on."
Great place to stay without breaking the bank and cool things to do on the property.  They seemed to stop taking great care of this Hotel so the lack of attention to detail make a stay here not luxurious.
"I had trouble talking to staff because of their attitude for no reason, and I try to go to upper management, but upper management transfer me to the front desk again and no one answered the phone I was disconnected"
"Plenty of amenities to choose from. It was busy, but not so crowded that you couldn't play at the tables or slots. The only drawback was lack of sleep due to our room being near the icemaker on our floor."
"Looking for a great visit to Vegas ? Look no further than the Luxor. Clean rooms , friendly staff and quiet rooms . Went in February and was pleasantly surprised that the day club pool at Mandalay Bay is free to use for Luxor guests . The infinity hot tub was great . Pool was not as warm as expected but hey it was February."
We were given a noisy room on the 2nd floor with a view of the parking garage wall and no cell reception.  I complained and they offered me a room on the 3rd floor and told me nothing else was available. They finally gave me a room on the 21st floor when I refused the 3rd floor room.  This was on a Thursday at 3pm!
"My second visit to Vegas with a buddy and the Luxor was an awesome trip. From the front desk throughout the casino was the best trip so far. I experienced the Shark exhibit, which was a wonderful adventure. I will stay again at the Luxor!!!!"
"Just a Cheap old hotel and smells bad and the access to rooms is very difficult.  Room was clean, TV and Internet were in and out, no water in the room, and the walls are thin.  I heard a couple fighting all night next door."
"The offers and prices will lure you in.... But beware!  Lots of flooding issues in the hotel. Then the flooding made its way to our bathroom. Ruined all of my expensive makeup. Over a week later and I still have not heard anything about the security report I filed for replacement. They gave us a $100 food credit that doesn't even cover a meal for 3. Security was useless. Dated hotel, escalators breaking, you will be ""miles"" away from your elevator. Rooms are not as pictured. There was not even a bedspread on the the bed. I would never recomend this place to a friend, maybe my worst enemy. Maybe..."
"We stayed at Mandalay Bay but used Luxor Spa…. My husband booked an 80 minute spa service on February 11th at Luxor. They had him use a locker in the men’s locker room to place his items in during the service. The Locker room attendant told him to use locker 37 and gave him a small key to it. There was only one person in the locker room which was this young guy attendant on duty. Needless to say this employee is a thief! My husband came out of spa service to retrieve his clothing and items to find an alert on his cell phone from our credit card company. ( phone was in jacket pocket and wallet in pants pocket) He called them and they said someone was physically charging to his card in stores in the last few minutes .. Apple $1200, Victoria Secret $400, Bath& Body $300 at the Town Center shopping center 1/4 mile south of Luxor..  He checked his wallet and $200 was missing as well as this credit card. Yep… Luxor has a locker room employee stealing!! They have master keys and or this locker 37 is faulty by design!!!  This is organized crime meaning this employee steals and passes off to someone else that will go use the card immediately ( these charges I’m certain are gift card purchases due to the even amounts). I built a career in upper retail management so Im very familiar with theft. Needless to say DO NOT use the Spa lockers at Luxor!!! Yes a police report was filed and we were told they would review cameras and catch any employee however we are not holding our breath!!  Luxor I hope you take this seriously because a thief will strike again… especially a professional one!!!"
"For years I've wanted to stay in a King Corner Suite room.  Now as far as suites go, i didnt expect much here, other than a roomier room.   This was a friends trip, but we all had our own room (it is vegas).  I arrived a lil earlier than check in and was still given my room w/o fee (The other major player on the strip charges for early arrival)

The King Corner has a nicely updated bathroom(the shower floor can get a lil slick), the updated wall paper behind the bed, a side sitting room with a sofa & fridge, and a LARGE soaking tub off to the side of the bed in front of the pyramid glass.    1st impression was I LOVED THIS ROOM for many reasons!

This room has 2 ac units in it.  Normally , especially in the summer, because the building is black glass, it can get quite hot, and usually the AC cant keep up (for someone who likes it cold).  For the 1st time ever in a vegas hotel room, i got cold at night and LOVED IT!   Definitely spacious on my solo room stay and perfect for a couple.   The king bed in this room was raised HIGH.   Possibly too high for some people, but my bed at home is just as high and i loved it.  The room was clean, although because of my insane cleaning habbits, everything was sprayed with lysol and or wiped with clorox wipes, IT IS VEGAS....lol

If your a rewards player and get a deal on this room type, or you just want a slightly roomier room, i greatly appreciated this room.  I did use the soaking tub several times to relax,   I wish it was jetted, but it still got the job done.  The fridge in the room is a nice bonus to keep some waters and sodas cold.  I usually prefer a tower room, but i would definitely stay in this room again."
"Just ok. The pros were that the bed & pillows were comfy & the shower was great (which are very important pros to me). Everything else was blah including the customer service. The cigarette smoke IN THE ROOM was suffocating. Most surfaces were dusty throughout the hotel & it’s just really dark & dingy. Visiting other hotels/casinos it became more apparent that the Luxor management isn’t on the same level. The spa was okay. I think my massage therapist was good but the spa touches were lacking & the fee’s weren’t up front. As far as my confirmation, booking online including tip was $200 but it somehow cost $280 in the end. I most likely wouldn’t stay here again if any other hotel is comparable in price per night on the strip."
"The room was in poor condition, no water pressure in the shower and dirty room. Property and elevators was in bad shape (East Tower)! Aurora bar waitress was unfriendly and uninvited told me no specials, ask for drinks and she referred me to the menu!"
The hotel was clean . I just love staying at the Luxor it is my all time favorite place . The staff is friendly and so helpful . The only call out would be no ice machines on suite level and without the correct key it won’t let you down a level.
"I was on a business conference February 2023. My stay at the Luxor was awesome! From staff, to the room, to the casino, the food and the shopping were all fantastic! Everything you could possibly want to see was either within walking distance or a very short cab ride. I am hoping some day soon, I will be able to take a personal trip to Las Vegas and if I do, I will be staying at the Luxor!"
"The mobile check in process is abysmal. Also the mgm parking pass is so I’ll conceived that it’s more annoying in practice than just paying daily. Luxor was ok, but I would suggest paying extra for better."
"Did a staycation here and pleasantly surprised by how nice the place was, lived in Vegas 30 years and have never been here. Check-In and key were on the app, so easy. Everything centrally located and very convenient. Rooms all overlook everything which is cool as well."
The hotel is only 5 mins from the airport and with the flat rate and evening add on with tip came to $27. We had requested  a Pyramid Premier two queen room & close to the  lifts and this was accommodated by a person rather than a machine. The room was lovely and nicely decorated with a spacious shower room (shower pressure was really good) Unfortunately the mattresses on both beds where terrible and dipped in the middle. We did discuss requesting replacements however we were only there for 4 nights but it did make a difference to our overall rating of the hotel. The food areas varied quite considerably in price and quality as do the bars. There are several attractions and shows but do make sure you look around for discounts. We love the overall feeling of The Luxor but you need to be aware of its location in relation to the rest of the main strip.
I enjoyed my stay. Idk wish they had at least a microwave in room. Rouge was a good show. Bagel spot in Excalibur was disgusting. Johnny rockets burger was good. Writing this essay for a review is annoying.
"If the price is right, stay. There's nothing to write home to mom about. Elevators ate in desperate need of attention.  The casino is fine, the environment is fine.  The hotel is just a bit older.  You won't be blown away and you likely won't hate it.  It's in the middle"
Great hotel for the value.  Large very clean rooms.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.   Loved the location pretty easy walk to anything on the strip. We had a great time and we will be going back.
"*Room was clean, well maintained and recently renovated 
*Common areas were clean. Many escalators and walkways were out of order, but this seemed common throughout Vegas.  
* Easily walk to Mandalay Bay or Excalibur without going outside. Close to MGM Grand and New York New York Hotels. 
*Good was good in any or the hotels we ate at. Expensive, but good. 
*Monorail can be picked up at MGM Grand a bit of a walk, but a good way to get yo north end of Strip."
Waiting on staff to let us out and waiting on the gate to be fix. Multiple times we had to wait for someone to let us out. They didn’t fix it and the car line got backed up a lot. It was the worst. And being charged for parking while staying there is something we shouldn’t have to do.
I explained in previous comments about the hard mattress the very dirty carpet with the large amount of dust in the corners of the carpet is very disgusting. The toilet wasn’t flushing properly every single time we used it the water had a terrible odor. Every time you wash your hands my daughter’s room a couple rooms down had a huge hole in the wall. It look like there was some kind of weak and they just left the cut sheet rock there on the floor. The whole was about 4’ x 18” and that was from the hallway to her room you could have possibly gain access if you wanted to.
"The staff was great, and the rooms were very nice, but the property has some issues. The moving walkways between Luxor, Excalibur and Mandalay Bay, were not working throughout almost our entire stay. Many of the restaurants had limited hours of operation, which caused us to go off property for many of our meals."
My stay was mostly good. I do wish my suite had a microwave and coffee pot to go with the fridge. The elevator system Was frustrating and I was hurt. When I reported my Injury I felt like it wasn’t their problem and they didn’t care. They did nothing but have me fill out a form
"The service was great.  The hotel is old and needs renovated and updated.  The entertainment was non-existent. Hotel staff did a great job. This hotel was ok, however, I wouldn’t stay there again.  No fridge or micowave in the rooms."
"We was excited to get an opportunity to be able to stay at such an iconic lodging option in Vegas during a roughly (12-hour) layover in between flights. Wanted to to just get some rest at a nice room, eat and play. Upon checking in, the front desk was already confused with our hotel reservation stating that our check out was going to be 2-days more than what we booked (3-day in total apparently). What we actually booked was 1 night stay with paid late check out. We spent roughly 10-15 minutes about our booking, our situation and why we booked it. The front desk, finally “got it”, gave us our key and we were on our way. Hotel room was okay, needs some renovations, but nothing too harsh to comment on. We dropped our bags in the room and went to get breakfast, since we came in on a red-eye flight and did I mention that we checked in at 8:30-8:45am. We got breakfast, and played in the casino for roughly 2 hours and decided it was time to nap and get ready for the next leg our flights. As soon as we got into the room, we were almost immediately met with the sound of our hotel door and the card reader rejecting someone’s key. We opened the door to a confused couple insistent that we were staying in their room. We explained that we just checked in and we’re assigned this room. We called the front desk to square away this issue and the women in this couple went to the front desk. After waiting for what could have been 15-20 minutes on hold, I talked with a front desk personnel and explained what was happening. We were told that they checked us out of hotel room, apologized and “confirmed” that we were checked back in and saw notes about our late check-out. We felt a little relived until we got knocks on our door 15 minutes later and the couple is with security asking to check-in about our situation, confirm our confirmation and even asked/ demanded us to go to the front desk to get this squared away since in everyone’s eyes, we were illegally squatting and weren’t suppose to be there. They asked us to pack our stuff and get out basically. My husband grabbed our hotel confirmation, card holder that had written notes that we were “confirmed” for late check out at 3pm and showed the security personnel as he and the security personnel made their way to the lobby. In the elevator, security was dumbfounded that we had our confirmation with proof that we were paying guests, had documentation and my husband explain our situation. Security almost instantly before getting to the front desk, received confirmation that front desk had notes in our reservation and that we were “okayed” to continue our stay in room. At this point we felt violated, accused of actions and put in a situation that could have been completely avoided had proper notes at check-in been made. When we checked out at 3pm, my husband wanted to talk with the front desk to get an explanation and we’re basically told, “we apologize, but you’ll have to talk to the security manager to complain about this situation. Basically we paid to feel like criminals. Long story, is that my husband and I will probably not be staying at this hotel moving forward with how unprofessional, unorganized and the lack of communication and empathy their front staff/reservations and security had. We truly don’t make any complaints or feel the need to share bad lodging stays, but this has been one of the worst experiences in our almost 15 years of travel together. Expect to have trouble if you select and pay for the late check options since communication is something that strongly needs to improve. I understand that things happen, but with how the hotel staff handle this, I was highly disappointed and frustrated and would have appreciated some compensation instead of given the run around."
"Hotel staff just walks i to your room without knocking.  I was laying in my bed on the phone and with just my underwear on, when someone from housekeeping or maintenence just walked right in.  No apology or anything, just an ""oops"" from him."
"Rooms are out dated, music playing outside room 24/7. Had to pay $18 day for parking, $25 for a refrigerator. No hair dryer in room and room had a smell.  Gym was nice and clean, guest services was helpful as could be."
"The staff was very unhelpful and at times very rude. It didn’t leave me with a yearning to return as so many places have in the past. 
 The rooms are forty miles away from any kind of entertainment. Of course no that far. But it certainly felt that way. 
Zero room service after 1in the afternoon. Not sure how that would work for anyone."
"The Hotel is very nice but the drink and food prices are extremely high compared to Fremont Street and the slots did not pay well. We took an Uber ride to downtown and enjoyed that much more. The Luxor does have a heavy cigarette smell to it, for a non-smoker it was a turn off."
"Waited 20-30 minutes for elevators. Even when an elevator showed up, it was a high probability that you had to pass on it because it was full.. In the rooms there were holes in the sheet rock, paint peeling from walls and carpet missing in room.. at least it was cheap to stay‍♂️"
"Check in is always an adventure. Long wait lines and not enough staff. 
Couldn't sleep on the old, soft, smelly mattress provided in the room. 
Air conditioner was noisy and never really got the room to the temperature I would have liked."
Was suppose to be wonderful wedding experience turned into nightmare we had to extend our stay for 2 more nights do to a booked flight and we’re assured that’s what we had only to be locked out of our rooms and had to pay for another night
This was our first time staying at Luxor.  Everything was great.  The suite was the most amazing hotel room in which we have ever stayed.  The service was superb. Everyone was friendly and professional!   We will return.
"We recently stayed at the Luxor and as always ir was fantastic!! It is our favorite place to stay on the strip, staff is extremely friendly and the atmosphere was incredible. Also, as always breakfast at Pyramid Cafe was incredible!!"
"Loved our week at Luxor. We do not normally go in the winter but threw a wee trip in to build our points to get to Gold again this year. Hotel stay was awesome, super clean room and very friendly service.
Can’t wait to go back"
"I had multiple problems and dissatisfactions at my stay at the Luxor recently.  First the check-in process was a nightmare.  I booked my room using the MGM Resorts app and upon arrival at the airport at 7:30 a.m. the 1st day of my stay, I use the app to check into my room to get a digital key.  The oven for me that my digital key was not ready yet but it would be available shortly.  So I spent another couple of hours getting something to eat and making my way over to the hotel from the airport and it still had not arrived.  I paid the extra $20 for early check-in since my flight got in so early I needed to drop my luggage off at the room before attending a conference and when I arrived at the hotel I could not use my digital key at all and the looks or staff at the front desk was not helpful at all because they were telling me to check in on a Mobile kiosk after waiting in line for an hour and then I wasn't able to get an actual key or use my digital key and she told me that my room wouldn't be not ready until 3:00 p.m. even though I had paid for the early chicken so I was forced to take my baggage with me over to the Venetian Caesar's Expo forum for the SHOT show conference that I was in town for.  

So after logging my bags into an Uber over to the conference finding somewhere to store them while I was there until 5:00 p.m. and then bringing my bags back to the Luxor to go to my room I then had to wait in line at the front desk again to actually speak to a front desk agent because the digital key on my phone would not work on the elevator so I had to go all the way back down and wait in line to get an actual key to even get to my room.

Then once I get to my room my bathroom was very dirty I've seen worse but I definitely expected better.  My toilet had urine in it like someone had recently used it there was hair in my sink and in the shower and there was still trash in the trash can next to the toilet.

And to top everything all off my room was at the end corner of a hallway that was right next to a staircase door that apparently everyone on the floor used to go stand in the doorway of the staircase and smoke marijuana so that filtered under the door of my room so I got to smell that all night every night for my entire four night stay. 

On one of my trips down to the lobby from my room upon exiting the elevator I saw one of the security Personnel in the yellow jackets so I politely went over and asked them if there was anything they could do about the people smoking marijuana right outside my door because it was filtering into my room and I really didn't appreciate it.  And I was very sharply told that there is nothing that they could do about it because it's Nevada and it's legal even though I was under the impression that smoking in or around the guest rooms was not permitted.  The lady looked at me like I was doing something wrong by complaining instead of the group of people standing outside my door smoking marijuana doing something wrong.  

Then later on on my third night at the hotel I was at a roulette table playing for a few hours and not once but twice your roulette personnel that was working the table short paid me on a win one of the times was over $340 that they shorted me the second was about $160 that they shorted me.  I had the sense of mind to catch the mistake and made it known and he redid his calculations and admitted that he had made an error and corrected it both times however it made everyone at the table uncomfortable that he was trying to short people and then it actually happened again to another lady for $75 and she didn't catch it so I spoke up and said something and he yelled at me and said you need to worry about your own money and stop encouraging everybody to complain.  So I then called The Pit Boss over who was a older blonde white lady and she proceeded to scold me for the same thing telling me that if it wasn't my money I needed to mind my own business and if I had an issue I didn't need to talk to the guy running the roulette table I needed to call her over first.  I was extremely angry at that response as I had done nothing wrong at the table except point out a mistake that your roulette Personnel had made and that they admitted to making after I caught it.

So to sum it up my experience with the Luxor Hotel and MGM and resorts in general was not favorable and I most definitely will think twice before picking an MGM location on my next trip to Vegas.  I think Caesars will be the next one I try and that's unfortunate as I do love a few of your other properties as well but if this is the sort of experience I can expect I'm not in any hurry to experience it again."
"I absolutely love this hotel, perfect place for just about anything and everyone no matter the hours. I just wish there was a microwave in the room , but other than that I wouldn’t book anywhere else but the Luxor , close to the strip, 24 hours places to eat or other choices within walking distance , staff is very friendly and informational when needed"
Not impressed with our stay. Rooms missing standard amenities such as fridge and microwave. Bed was very uncomfortable. Titanic exhibit was worth going to see. The ability to travel from Excalibur to the Luxor and to Mandalay Bay was handy.
"I stay at Luxor 2-3 times a year out of my 3-5 trips I make to the city. Great location to stay you can easily travel up the strip from here using the tram.  Plus I love the tables here, and staff is very helpful for new players."
My stay was not the worst but not the best . I do appreciate the $75 dollar restaurant credit . But the staff really wasn’t friendly . The rooms were so run down . The food very over priced for the quality. The best part was the spa for sure . And how convenient it was to get to two different hotels . I do think they need a security guard standing at the elevators Especially for woman . A drunk man tried getting in a elevator with me and wasn’t even from the same hotel . Thank goodness a couple got in at that moment i mention no room key you can’t go up he starred at me than stepped out .
"This was a quick trip before a business trip. The staff at the front desk was amazing! Very thoughtful and courteous. The room felt a bit outdated, but for the price, I really didn't mind. I wish I could have explored more of the hotel and hope to do so in the future!"
"Everything was pretty standard. Long line ups very busy place, elevators were slow with lots out-of-servce.. not a ton of food options. Casino was really hard on my luck.  Would probably not stay again"
"This was a great visit, I had no issues and price was awesome! The room was clean and the check in via mobile was easy and quick, Within walking distance of the NYNY and MGM also tram was awesome between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur."
"we all had a great time, and there was 8 of us for a 21 st.  birthday. everyone in the casino  was very helpful with directions.  Every where we ate the  food was so very good. The slot machines were spread out nicely never felt to close to someone."
Awesome The reception area were very helpful. The room was nice and tidy and clean all around. Everybody was super friendly. And the shows were awesome. America’s got talent was a really really nice show
Room for a lot of improvement. Room booked may not be what you get.  Take sinuses medication they don't have that available.  Keep your clothes on; housekeeping will just walk in without notice. The table crew are AWESOME
Great hôtel.  The exposition of the Titanic is magic. The room are clean and confortable . A lot of people but still very calm . The people at the desk was very great . The bed was confortable. The hôtel was very clean
"The hotel and rooms were very nice. Areas are clearly marked throughout the facility to allow for simple travel. The food and drinks were made well and in a quick fashion. My only gripe is with how poorly the elevators have been maintained. Broken buttons, open panel and readers that would just glitch completely."
We have stayed at the Luxor many times but after this last visit I think we will try one of the other Mlife resorts. Our room was great but overall the casino was disappointing. I found it very smoky and extremely loud.
We had another great stay at the Luxor.  Room was very clean and I love the shower (great pressure).  Everything you need is inside the hotel or in the connect properties of Excalibur or Mandalay Bay.  I love the breakfast at the Pyramid Cafe.  Omelletes are awesome!
"Was upgraded to a tower room. The room was just okay. No frills but the bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean!! The bathtub drained very slowly. Took over an hour. 

The customer service within the hotel and casino was excellent!! Housecleaning was great! Had the brunch buffet and it was very good. Look forward to my next Vegas adventure."
"The Luxor has spacious, older rooms at an affordable price.  It is the closest from the airport so the cab ride is short.  The staff are super friendly.   I ran out of time, but when I come back, I will try the spar."
"Don't expect to have a top tier room, no matter how much you pay. Apparently the towers are a better option and the towers were not good. Wallpaper was falling off the wall, and the sink had a horrible smell to it. The only perk to this stay is that it's connected to Mandalay bay, Excalibur and new York new York."
Had a great time. Definitely worth the value. Real close to Raiders Stadium. Easy access to Mandalay Bay. Easy Uber/Lyft access. The “Fantasy” show was amazing. I will definitely come back and stay here
"Old rooms that are dirty. Beds are horrible. They don’t have fridge, microwave, or coffee makers. The paint was peeling off in the bathroom and it was just all around a rundown hotel room that we will not be going back to."
"Filthy room , mold in restroom , garbage u def the bed , coffee table glass had many cup rings with sticky juice everywhere , hair on pillows , large red stain on carpet and litle stains everywhere . The location of the room wasn’t that great , I love the towers , but this time we tried the pyramid and we’re very disappointed with the room , and the condition . It wasn’t cleaned and with covid it was very concerning ."
"This hotel is massive but that’s not a negative point, the room we stayed in was beautiful. It was a 1 bedroom tower suite and well worth the extra money. I can’t fault the hotel in terms of cleanliness, location etc. I have 2 negatives to take away. 

1) Too many lurkers, this isn’t the fault of the hotel as they can’t stop this from happening. Lurkers are people who hang around the machine waiting for you to lose so they can jump straight on your machine the moment you press the cash out button. They’re not discreet either, they are blatantly watching you play the machine and you can see them getting more excited as your dollars are going down. However you can have some fun with it by pressing cash out and pretend to get up but then sit back down and put another $20 in….they don’t like that. Anyway too many of them and it does spoil your enjoyment in the casino a bit. 

2) We were given a complimentary drinks voucher as we were celebrating my birthday during our stay which we thought was a very nice touch. The ticket said we were eligible for 2 free “champagne” drinks, as we are both tee total we asked if we could exchange them for 2 soft drinks. We went to the flight bar inside the hotel and said we don’t drink and could we possibly exchange them for a sprite or Pepsi and the blonde haired lady behind the bar said no. She was so rude in her response and completely cut us off, she said “it’s champagne or nothing” and that “they can’t be exchanged for anything else”. Now we understand the exchange policy if we were asking for different alcoholic drinks but we were literally asking for a sprite or Pepsi WHICH THEY GIVE FOR FREE WHEN PLAYING THE MACHINES AT THE BAR??? How does that make any sense??? Anyway that put a slight dampener on the birthday celebrations. 

On the whole a lovely hotel but those 2 negatives do stick out when thinking of this hotel for us"
"the photos online are of the updated version of the rooms and not the 90s hellscape they had me check into.

The premiere king suite that was shown on the website, which i paid handsomely for, was not the clean, updated room shown in the website. The room I was given was far outdated in every aspect besides the bedding. The tub in the room was littered with pubic hair. The new samsung tv was somehow configured to function as an early 2000s dvd main menu. I am disappointed in the quality of the room and lack of transparency - I have never been catfished in my life until I checked into this room. 

I chose the luxor and splurged on the room as a romantic treat for my significant other’s birthday vacation. This definitely put a damper on the trip."
The hotel was very clean and staff was extremely friendly. Lots to do at the hotel and lots of good food (public house has the best loaded fries in the world). Lots of things within walking distance and easy access to be picked up by Lyft drivers.
"This was an amazing time, I enjoyed everything starting from the hospitality when I pulled Upton the check in process to the rooms and the food.  The over all stay was nothing short of amazing,  I would definitely recommend this hotel to others."
The smell of the room and the water was enough for me to never stay here again. Not to mention the furnishings were awful and old and the refrigerator was rusty. My room had the big bathtub but unless you bring bleach and dawn to clean it yourself it’s unusable. Overall just spend $50 to $100 more a night and stay somewhere else.
"Stayed for one night and found our room perfectly priced with the location we preferred.  The spa and couples massage was exceptional, and ambiance of the whole place suited us well.  Most of all, pet friendly!!!"
I really think the staff is trying to make this a good experience but the Hotel itself is dated and not in very good condition. Room amenities are sub-par. No fridge no coffee pot. Even motel 6 has a damn coffee pot. If you want to gamble and take and escort to a room this place might be ok for that. If you want to actually relax in a nice room then maybe not.
Came to Vegas with 8 people and the Luxor was the best offer with mgm comps available at the front of the strip so it’s a walk everywhere Uber pick up and dropping off was convenient rooms a little dated and bathrooms could use a refresh
"Way to much to type. To keep it short Rooms are horrible and dirty. First room I was assigned to had peoples belongings in them. Never again…. Told them I was pregnant and having slight contraction, had my husband and I walk across the casino when rooms were available right next to the check in counter. Again never again…."
"Great location. This hotel has everything well cared for, a tad musty in the halls. Only complaint is elevator buttons and key card access was consistently malfunctioning. Staff was great price was great."
"We booked a trip to see Americas Got Talent which has a residence at the Luxor hotel. I am limited in mobility so decided to stay here for only one reason, the proximity to the show. After reading some reviews I was a little hesitant and did not have high expectations for these accommodations. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  From check in to check out the people were great, the room was nice (nothing fancy but we didn’t need fancy) the bed clean and comfortable and the service people were all very nice!  The Luxor Cafe was great and our waitress Alecia was wonderful. My only complaint was they at night the Wi-Fi was not great as the TV kept going on and off but that’s it! If you are looking for luxury, stay somewhere else. If you are looking for comfort, and a pleasant place to stay, gamble,eat and see a show without costing an arm and a leg (besides your gambling of course) then this is a great place to stay!!! Would go again!"
"All of the staff made my stay special, and went above and beyond without me having to ask. I also strongly recommend the spa. It was clean and a safe and comfortable atmosphere to really decompress in."
Room was dirty. Housekeeping not doing their job. Found dirty sock and bottled water in room from previous occupant upon check in. Housekeeping forgot to clean room one of the days. One of the pillows smelled of vomit and had a stagnant bad odor. Must have not been cleaned.
"Overall good stay,I had a leak in my room on the first day due to rain then I was upgraded. The staff is very friendly and the hotel is very clean. The buffet was really good and the chefs and staff were very friendly."
Rooms a bit dated but nice and good value for the money fun hotel good place on the strip valet and Uber pickup the best on the strip for ease of use also was the hotel that smelled the least of marijuana so they are on that in the Luxor
Had to eat cold food and drink warm drinks. There was no microwave or refrigerator in the room. And when I went downstairs to try and get some food warmed up they told me they wouldn’t be able to do that for me
"This property needs a good scrubbing from the top down- like a lot of Vegas properties it’s starting to really show its ago. I have stayed at most of the major properties in Vegas, and the Luxor did disappoint this time around."
Stayed a week and had a great experience. Clean room and friendly staff. Although an older hotel kept in good order. A mini fridge in the room would be a great addition but overall happy with the stay.
"Luxor is beautiful! Our room quite large, immaculate and enjoyable! Easy to get around the hotel. Starbucks is so busy but that’s expected!  Check in was fast and accommodating. Slight early check in which was very much appreciated! 
Would stay again!"
Great value At the Luxor. Close to every thing and a tram to take u to other hotels. West tower rooms were clean and nice.  Good view out of our window of pyramid and Allegiant stadium. Convenient Starbucks locations!!
MGM has basically given up on this hotel.  Very poorly maintained.  Mop left in room. Hair in sink. Broken towel rack.  Moldy shower. Broken tiles.  Rate they quote is half of what you pay once you pay Resort fees and sept parking fees which are what valet should cost.   Don’t stay here.
"Great place to stay. The casino has a great range of games and sport book. It's a little further down the strip but the tram is convenient being able to go Mandalay Bay or excalibur. You have to go see Americas Got talent if they have shows during your stay. The shows are at the Luxor, which is a bonus!"
"Then they sent a engineer the first time to fix my heat,he said he fixed it and to give it about 30 minutes to heat up,I left for about 2 hours to come back to the same cold rooms,then they move me to another room and I had the same problem this time they couldn't even fix the problem,so they moved me again,"
Broken A/C in a corner suite. Dated rooms. Plugs so worn a phone charger wouldn’t even stay in the plug. Slots were the tightest I’ve seen in Vegas. No real with rewards with MGM rewards. Even the food court food was outrageously expensive.
Bad services  room services s 0 stayed 5 days  room didnot clean  on daybam leving they cometo clean  dont like to call every day yo askfor towells anf for somemone to come and clean room room s smell bad
I didn’t like this hotel at all. It smells and is really old in decor. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they were looking for somewhere just to to sleep without luxury.  Restaurants food was overpriced and tasted awful
"Hotel was out dated. Nothing special about this place. Staff is not helpful. Wait staff in restaurants are rude especially at the Public House. Will not be back at least not to this property. We had a leak from our ceiling in our room, soaked our suitcase of clothes. Leak was fixed by a towel being placed in our room. Horrible service to say the least."
Stayed at this hotel. Elevator smelled like pee. Two things went missing from our room. Put the do not disturb sign to make sure nothing else goes missing from our room but cleaners still went inside of room and put do not disturb sign back inside the door handle in room.
loved staying in a pyramid the corner room was amazing the hot tub was awesome and it was nice being able to travel to the other hotels just need to fix you mechanical walk ways looked kind off trashy the way there just not working but hey that’s an easy fix
"Hotel room was quiet and clean. It was not overly crowded. The wait to check in was a little long, but overall it was a good stay. I would definitely recommend staying here. The only thing this place does not have is a night club."
"My 4 day stay at the Luxor was very enjoyable.The casino had great ventilation smoke was not a problem, it was well lit and not congested. I was easy to move about. My room was clean, quiet, modern and spacious. Self parking was quick and easy."
"The rooms are very beat up (stucco flaking off, electrical components not working, couches so worn they have no cushion in some spots) and dated. They want to charge you extra for a fridge when most places give you a fridge. The elevators are a disaster (buttons not working, doors broken, absurd noises, the list goes on). Hall carpets stained and rolled/stretched out."
"We were near the elevator and could hear loud people in the middle of the night.  Could even hear the guy next door sigh when he was urinating. The toilet wouldn't flush the toilet paper.  There was big, long dark hairs in the bathroom sink.  The place is old and run down."
"Bad service nothing was the accurate what they said. They need to help more and ask if people need help
Or explain what they going to charge and not get over charge of another amount that wasn’t said."
"For the price, probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The suite was huge. House keeping staff did a great job.   Looking forward to my next trip to Las Vegas later this year. Would do it again and again."
"It was just another excellent Vegas stay! Once again, there were not any real issues of note at all with the stay! It was another smooth Vegas trip, as I have begun to expect from any Vegas getaway! Outstanding!"
This hotel was beautiful and the theme was very cool! We had a king suite with a tub by the window and it was awesome. My biggest complaint is the location. 10 min Uber to treasure island & Caesar’s palace.
"Had a great time. Check in was easy, rooms are clean and comfortable. Small little maintenance things need to be performed, but over all great room. Luxor seems to have less food options than other hotels on the strip, however you can find something if needed."
"This was my first trip to Vegas and I couldnt be happier with the Luxor. Clean rooms, great atmosphere and friendly staff. The restaurants are nice and the gambling was more relaxing than many of the other casinos we visited during our stay. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice/easy overall experience."
"Affordable hotel prices, close to the Las Vegas strip, walking distance of many entertainment options. Luxor has friendly customer service. Digital room key and mobile check out are fast and easy to use."
"Fun, excellent, would stay here again. Staff was great along with the atmosphere of the Luxor hotel itself. 

The rooms were clean and unique. After all this is one of the original hotels on the strip. 

I highly recommend seeing the Carrot top show. Hilarious.

Overall, i would recommend to friends and family."
Vegas baby It was electric I had such a good time The shrine game was at the hotel right across from allegiance stadium Hot venue h*** of a stadium The Super Bowl was definitely back in 2024 Las Vegas Nevada Super Bowl Vegas baby
"No amenities (no bottled water, no coffee in room),problem with check in on hotel app, getting room cleaned was a problem, pipe burst so no water for several hours. Better stay at budget hotel!  When I complained the staff basically called me a liar."
"Flight was delayed and charged $200 for now show fees after we were told it was going to be okay. Luxor downgraded our room & check-in employees were ridiculously rude, including Mangrs Bianca and Garrett."
"I would stay at the Luxor again in a heartbeat, it was in a nice location and the casino and resort were great.  We really liked the having the three casinos connected, it made for safe travel late at night to different casinos."
Great hotel. It’s on the end of the strip and still walking distance for everything. Very clean and ALL THE STAFF were all so helpful. It was affordable abd I ended up signing up for the rewards program for exclusive deals!
I highly recommend the Luxor.  Sizable and very nice rooms and close to the action but yet positioned at the edge of the strip. Also close to the famous Bootleggers Italian restaurant which may have the best in town with entertainment. I highly recommend the Luxor
I love the way the hotel looks and feels. My go to place to get some rest whenever I’m in Las Vegas. I’d highly recommend to anyone who is either interested in gambling or the hospitality side of Las Vegas.
Stand in the priority line. Anybody can stand there if the line is long. I recommend staying here. The staff is friendly and the Tower rooms are so much better in person. It was better than expected. I like this hotel
Stool on the sheets!!!!! When we arrived we pulled the sheets back ( I do this everytime I travel). To my surprise there was stool YES poop on two different areas of the sheets!!! Unexceptable! I will not stay here again!
If you are looking to experience the strip Luxor is definitely a great place. It’s at the beginning of one end which affords you the opportunity to travel down the strip and not miss anything. Purchased a three day transit card and the bus stops outside of the hotel. Great place. Good atmosphere
"We usually stay at Caesar properties but MGM has started sending us offers that we couldn’t refuse. We booked a room at Luxor and was pleasantly surprised. We were in the West tower. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. You can adjust the room temp to your liking (meaning they don’t have it blocked from going below 68 degrees-unlike many of Caesar’s properties). Bathrooms are very nice. The only bad things are there is not a refrigerator and you can hear stuff going on outside the room. 
MGM properties have a monorail that is free that takes you to their properties. This really came in handy for us. 
Give this place and other MGM
Properties a chance. You won’t be disappointed."
"Property was good but a bit dated. Plenty of restaurants, gaming and shows.  Location is south strip which we enjoyed and it's close to the deuce bus stop plus there's a free tram to Excalibur and Mandalay bay. Bed was very comfortable. Big, clean rooms and great price, we would not hesitate to stay again"
When we checked in me and my friend were at two separate tower’s because they changed her without a reason so I had to switch mine to the pyramid tower and we wanted to stay in the towers.  When we checked out at the desk we found out the next day that we never got checked out so we had to check out on the mobile app. At least we never got charged for late checkout. When gambling we hardly ever saw a waitress so we had to go to the shop and buy our drinks. Shouldn’t have to pay for a soda or water when gambling and already spending money. And if u eat at public house. You will hardly see your waitress
"I read a lot of bad reviews of the Luxor and I was expecting the worst, however I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in the tower. The room was clean and not run down. I liked the bathroom arrangement.  Everything worked, TV, hot water , as it should.  The hallway is a bit noisy when people walk thru talking loudly. I don't think anyone was in the room next to us, at least not that I could tell. The bed was a little too soft for me, but not terrible. My only issue was the drinking glass in our room had a bunch of Vaseline on the rim hidden under the paper sanitary lid. I didn't say anything as I didn't find it until our last night. Overall, I had a great stay. The Spa was nice, the buffet was good. I would totally stay here again."
"Our mobile check-in created an instant unknown charge on top of having the incorrect reservation information despite verifying in the confirmation email that it was correct. You're charged daily (not up front) for resort fees, parking is $28 a day whether you're a guest or not. Our thermostat was broken and took multiple workers over an hour to fix it while they tore the entire unit apart in our room. We called for extra pillows our first night there and went to bed after waiting over an hour. At 1:15AM, we were awakened from a dead sleep in the dark to a male worker having let himself into our room stating he had extra pillows that we called for. There was 1 elevator for the first 6 floors and one for the other 9 floors that you had to wait over 20 minutes every time for, the stairs are emergency exits only. During our stay, one of the elevators broke two different times while full of people. The inside was absolutely beautiful but the floors to the rooms were lined with stained carpet and broken plaster and it costs $30 a day to rent a refrigerator to ensure you're spending money on food at their property. You also do not get to earn rewards points if you book your stay through a third party website which is awful considering they get the money either way and you're spending hundreds more at their property while there. It was so disappointing for our first time to Vegas."
"Our plane was delayed a day and we were charged $200 for a ""no show"" after we called and notified the hotel. We were told if we checked in the next day it would be waived. The fees were still charged & Staff is rude."
My room's heating wasn't working and staff told me there was no solution for the problem.  I ended up having to request extra blankets for my weekend stay.  I would've expected for someone to fix the heating or even offer to switch me rooms.   The front desk just seemed like they didn't and couldn't be bothered.
Wasn’t impressed with the hotel for the price of everything. The location of the hotel was awesome. Saw prostitutes in the bar down stairs harassing customers and workers didn’t seem to mind at all. Thanks
Great value for a hotel on the strip. Rooms do not have microwaves or refrigerators but they were clean. Difficulty with the digital pass on my phone in the elevators was frustrating. Will not allow you to go to another floor.
We had a tremendous stay for my birthday trip. The front desk were super helpful & made us feel like VIPs. We loved everything about our stay at The Luxor! - King Pyramid Corner Room. Highly recommend!
"Staff not friendly, cursed at my wife.  Parking garage gate didn't work well, room smelled of pot, shower did not properly drain causing it to overflow in minutes.  Had to rent a refrigerator, called multiple times to front desk who never answered."
My wife and I took our 17 year old daughter to Vegas for a softball tournament and stayed at the luxor and the last time I was in Vegas was 22 years ago for my 21st birthday and the Luxor was where I stayed and I loved it then and this time it did not disappoint either but being in Vegas with your 17 year old can be a little challenging In sin city.
Not the best place to stay. We got sick eating at the pyramid cafe. Friend and I both had steak for breakfast and let’s just say it was out before you know it. Rooms are overpriced for the quality. Will not visit again
"Came for my nephew's hockey tournament. Stayed in the East Tower. Was charged over $200 a night for a room with no real amenities (no mini fridge, one tiny bar of soap, 1 tube of crappy lotion and 1 tube of crappy shampoo-conditioner combo)... found hairs in the tub that weren't mine, grout peeling in the shower stall, a stain on the wall, and multiple places in the hallways where the wallpaper had peeled off due to water damage but either had not been replaced, or was literally pinned to the wall with thumb tacks). Elevators didn't always register a key card swipe, so you'd be stuck in elevator limbo. In short, old, gross, overpriced, and not well-maintained. Will not return."
"Overall the hotel was ok but the hallways and rooms just not clean and housekeeping was not done so I’d never go barefoot even in our own hotel room. Staff was ok, not overly helpful but not terrible. Staff in food court rude."
"Would give 0 stars if I could!! We stayed here from December 19-26th. After returning from our holiday, I found a $420 charge on my credit card. I called the hotel to inquire, spoke to Carla, she said she was the hotel manager.  I was told the charge was for smoking in the hotel room. However, neither myself or my boyfriend smoke. We were told the housekeeping supervisor had provided photos of ashes in the room as evidence. We requested the photos, Carla refused to forward photos of ashes in the room and said unless court ordered they would not be showing us. We’re disappointed we’re left with charges that we aren’t accountable for. As stated, we don’t smoke, it is impossible for there to be ashes left in that room."
"Not sure if Luxor is going down hill or if they were just off their game during this trip. My room was dirty, hallway had a minor flood that got my shoes wet continually. But staff was helpful and kind."
"The hotel is pretty cool in architecture and gaming access.  Food was good. The rooms were clean and quiet.  The entertainment area is lively with good floor directions, good access to walk to other hotels, nice staff."
"I've been coming to Las Vegas for about 7 years for the same company trip. And every year, we always book with Luxor. It's a nice distance from the Mandalay Bay Convention center without being too far. The staff is always super friendly and accomodating. We did switch up this year and go with a Tower Room, normally we are in the Pyramid. The room was super nice, but the bed and pillows were a bit soft for my liking. I do like that you need your room key for the elevator (for some reason, made me feel a bit safer)"
"Be well aware there is no fridge (which can be rented for a nominal $20 extra per day, on top of all the other fees). Also no coffee pot, but there are 3 Starbucks on property that charge dbl, because they can!"
"Luxor has great location or our football tourney. Rooms were good just wish the had fridge and microwave without extra charge. I love the shows, food and services the hotel provides and also staff was great."
The Luxor has  plenty of potential but MGM must spend a few dollars to update the rooms. Very outdated and dingy. The employees were very friendly and helpful. If the rooms and elevators would get a facelift this would be a great property.
"Time to start applying the resort fees and high room rates to the upkeep and repairs of the aging property. The casino is a myriad of bad smells, mostly that of marijuana. Definitely need to be running more than 2 Craps tables, especially in a weekend. Had to go elsewhere to get some table time"
"The exterior, entrance, and lobby of Luxor are luxurious but not the casino, hallways, rooms, or theater. The staff was very friendly but they did not clean our room but once during a 4 day stay. We had to reuse towels and also there was no conditioner provided in the shower. Overall I do recommend this hotel because I haven't found a nicer one for this price point. Egypt vibes are sweet. Wish they decorated the rooms like that."
"Stayed at the Luxor for a Vegas wedding. Received such great service and went to the exhibits. Had such a fun time, we extended our stay another night. On our final night we decided to visit the casino and we were more than surprised by the cleanliness and quick service provided by their staff."
"The Luxor is a high end venue with reasonable rates for the rooms. It has everything you need right there. The rooms are very nice, good size with nice mattress and large Samsung TV. There are good restaurants and a good food court that stays open late. The location is very good. It's close to Mandalay Bay , Excalibur and MGM. You can get a good deal on Priceline.com or Travelocity.com."
"I would stay there again if i wanted some action but also wanted just a little quieter than some other places.

I didn’t care for Diablos but pyramid cafe and the back stage dinner were great. I did not check out the buffet. They need coke product and something better than Starbucks."
"I booked a room with a hot tub for my husband, and I only to find out that the tub had not been cleaned out from the previous guest! There was no room service available! The toilet leaked and it was a complete waste of money for what we got for a three day weekend!"
"An old hotel that needs major upgrades. 
We moved twice before we accepted that the last move was the best we could get. Gnats, musky, bad drainage, and old mattresses. At buffet gentleman that was making omelets great! How ever, his job could be made easier by either labeling the assorted meats and veggies. He was asked by every guest what he were the choices. He repeated himself to every customer. A sign with choices would help make the line run smoother."
For been the hotel to be not in press with it.The bathroom floor dirty sticky. The sink not working. The elevators from parking structure to building not working. The elevators in the building some of them not working either. Issues to access the building had to pay every time i go in and my parking fee was included with my reservation fees and my key was still not working. Horrible hotel is not what i expected specially for been the type of hotel all nice and fancy.
"Don’t bother. They charge $200 a night, and my room literally had a mini fridge missing, a bathroom w no fan, and bathroom door with a 2-inch gap, 10-year old tv, etc. very poor quality. Skip it, and find something else."
"Grateful that vegas.com was able to cancel additional nights at RIO and secure the remaining 2 nights at Luxor. Room was definitely an upgrade to the suite that we had at prior hotel. Clean, coffee maker or fridge would have been nice. Staff was pleasant/helpful. Felt I was fairly compensated for issues with keys/access."
"Customer service is terrible. Staff is impolite and unwilling to help in a friendly way since the day we arrived! Our room was not cleaned for two days, so we had to call house keeping twice! Our TV was glitchy, we couldn’t even watch regular TV. We rented a movie and had to request a refund because the moving was choppy, we couldn’t watch it. When we told the front desk about it, it was completely dismissed. Also, the rooms have no fridge, no microwave, and no coffee maker, which was strange for such a hotel. I would not be staying at the Luxor again."
"Family room located next to ice machine (not ideal with kids, wouldn’t have cared if I didn’t have kids with me), dust on shelving in room, Trash under towel rack in bathroom and dresser, towels located very low in the bathroom"
Our stay was amazing!  We couldn't have asked for a better time!  Staff went above and beyond. Room and beds were amazing as well.  We ate at the Public House which was delicious. We had a slight problem with one of our showers which was taken care of right away.
"Elevator situation. Can take too long. Not enough elevators. They need room card to operate, some malfunction.

No fridge, no coffee, no parking. All these cost extra. Be aware.

Card to operate parking gates didn't work. They ""fixed"" it later, but, how can it break in the first place??? it's not like it run on Windows updates!"
Went to Vegas to celebrate my sons 21st birthday.  Staff was very friendly and courteous.  Check in and check out was a breeze.  Only complaint is that the room didn’t have a microwave and they were outdated. Needed remodeling.
"Short version: My sheets were stained with blood.  I was moved to a different room, but I was disgusted by the entire situation.  The person who switched my room was completely detached and treated the matter like it was just another day. Housekeeping came and changed the sheets. When I went back to my room, I found two other ladies going in bc the room was assigned to them after. My belongings were still in the room!! No sir! that is not OK. Traveler beware!"
"This is not a high end hotel.    Rooms are old and outdated.   Beds were uncomfortable.    On one side of our room, there were guests running a daycare.   On the otherside of our room was a porn studio I think.   Above our room sounded like a RAP recording studio-  not to mention the helicopters that constantly circle the north tower.    I bet king tut and cleopatra would stay there again."
"Everything was pretty much as expected...clean room, friendly staff, lots of games to choose from.  However, the amenities fall quite short.  There are no coffee makers in the upgraded rooms.  We stayed in a Tower Premier room, and had to spend $8-$10 for a cup of coffee down at Starbucks.  There are also no mini-fridges to store left-overs from high-priced meals."
"this hotel was disgusting. on top of getting items stolen out of my room- like clothes (ew!) the room was gross, the beds were so soft my back was killing me by the end of the trip, and the staff was rude. Save your money and go somewhere else, the Luxor is Trash!"
I was very satisfied with the experience and customer service we received. Will definitely recommend this hotel and casino to anyone.  I do wish the rooms had a refrigerator in them. Overall extremely good trip
"Live music is nice, but rooms are hardly sound proofed at all, so not exactly the restful setup before traveling out the next day. All guest services did to help was let me know it should be done by 1 am.

Parking pass didn’t work so had to wait in long line just to get other ticket validated.

Don’t waste your money here. Pyramid is cool but there are better places to try to sleep close by."
Hotel was old and outdated. The room we stayed in required a 29 floor climb on a shady elevator that seemed like it would break any minute. The room itself was dingy and dirty. Spend the extra hundred dollars you save on any other hotel
The rooms are run down. There are no usb chargers in the room. None of our party members won at the slots at all. There were 6 of us. The walls in the hallways were dirty and the wallpaper was peeling in areas. The buffet was gross and over priced. I doubt we will stay here again unless they make improvements.
"Great service, great amenities, clean rooms, house keeping was great, accommodated my brother who traveled with me that was handicapped, extended an extra day front desk made it effortless, staff was courteous and friendly"
"TV kept freezing in room even after maintenance came to fix it! 
valet supervisor chad was rude and unhelpful we double paid valet 
Never again 
This was a second try for us and still disappointed 
Last stay there was a used bandage in our bed linen."
Booked online.  Thought it was a great deal.  Check-in and discovered cost was several times higher than online booking.  Room was outdated.  Water smelled like sulfur.  “Resort” amenities included the closed pool and a list of things not included.  Thin walls.  And TV that hardly works.
"Despicable the charges for 99cents store non quality toiletries. Also, the cheap peeling tint in my room was tacky. I will strongly r to my company a change of hotels for 2024. And as the top representative in the West coast, my opinion will matter!"
"It was terrible. When we checked in, we saw the person who was next to see us walk away. The room had no microwave or fridge. The room was so plain. The shower was broken. I would never go there again"
Couples 2 day trip to las vegas. The Luxor exceeded our expectations. Good value for being on the strip and convenient to the things we were interested in doing. Rooms were quiet / good sound proofing and spacious. Best shower ever with excellent shower pressure and great temperature controls!!
"The rooms are old, the hotel is huge (expect a walk to the elevator), but the staff is very professional and polite. Nobody came to see the AC that didn’t really work (it acted funny.) No “DO NO DISTURB” slip."
"If you like to be treated like crap, have no running water randomly, love a room the has an overpowering smell of weed, and like to be told ""it is what it is"" or ""you can stay at another casino"" when complaining to the staff...... then this is the place for you! On more than one occasion they treated guests as if they were doing the guest a favor for them staying at the casino! And if you're a ""valued"" MLIFE Rewards member (Platinum or NOIR), you can forget about seeing a casino host or getting any support from the because they seem to either not be working, don't answer calls, and don't care. I received help from the Mandalay Bay casino host with unbelievable support, and I wasn't even staying with them! Their host couldn't get a Luxor casino host either...for a week! Worst two week stay I've had in Vegas, and I've been going for decades and been in some crappy places. Save yourself a bad vacation and stay at Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Aria, Bellagio, or hell...even Excalibur."
"Unless you’re on a super tight budget, stay somewhere else! There are options. 

If you must stay at Luxor, try to get a tower room and not pyramid. The pyramid rooms are super outdated and dirty. Trust me, stay away from pyramid rooms"
Loved my stay at Luxor. I went alone but did not feel lonely. Had a great time especially at the game tables. Food is great. Drinks at Diablo are the best. Staff service is exceptional. Elevator going sideways is an experience.
I would of liked to have made this hotel our go-to but our checkout experience was way odd. Really rude. I only like giving positive reviews but even my more patient wife didn't understand why were treated that way?
Good place nice comfortable bed clean rooms great check in good food nice grounds close to everything good value for the price helpful at front desk. Stayed for two nights and never had a problem. Thanks
Shower wouldn’t drain and made my room smell like sewage. Bathtub wasn’t cleaned from last user either. All this for a $10 upgrade I paid for. Won’t use Luxor and probably won’t stay at any Vegas resort again after this. Most likely will stay in Primm since it’s only 20/30 minutes outside of the city.
"I have stayed here several times but it seems the quality has gone down. I had issues with the TV not working, no hot water, uncomfortable bed, elevator issues. And we came across a pile of fecal matter in the hotel walking to our room. After being made aware, the staff still had not cleaned it up after 1 hour. Gross!"
"We stayed at the Luxor during a work trip.  It was comfortable and in close proximity to the expo we were attending.  Room was clean and bathroom seemed like it had been partially updated in recent years.  Another restaurant would be nice for the meals when you just don’t have time to go hunt an option down.  Diablo’s was pretty tasty, though!"
"With its quirky pyramid design and impressive exterior lights this hotel promised so much. Unfortunately it failed to live up to early expectations. The room despite being large and spacious had decor which was tired and tatty, much the same as the rest of the hotel. The facilities were poor, no mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities in the room and no housekeeping service to make up the room. When I tried to contact housekeeping to request clean towels the phone didn’t even work. Definitely would not recommend this hotel wish we had stayed in the Venetian which looked much nicer"
"Overall, I was satisfied.  However, I was quite disappointed that there was not a mini refrigerator nor a coffee pot in the room.  It's become such a standard in hotel rooms that I've stayed in over the years, that I did not even check that they were included when I booked my room.  I DID end up renting a mini refrigerator for $25.00."
"Another Vegas stay, this time to Luxor pyramid room. Noisy above and from check-in area where music seemed to play all night. Casino smokier than others and overall ventilation could use major upgrade. Pyramid inclinators also had operational issues during our stay."
"Terrible hotel and terrible service. The line to check in is a mile long at all times of the day. The room (I had a Suite) was outdated and smelled like smoke. The thermostat couldn’t hold a temperature and the TVs didn’t work. Just a gross and terrible stay. This Casino is equally trashy and gross, and it is not near any other relevant or nice casinos/hotels. Stay somewhere else like the Wynn or Encore, it’s worth the money."
"Great price. Much cheaper and just as good as The Mandalay Bay. Excellent, friendly staff. They do need better TVs. It wasnt HD but thats a tiny complaint. Very nice hotel and like I said, very reasonably priced."
"Overall my stay was ok. I would come again, but would probably opt for a more expensive room. I kind wish I'd got the opportunity to see the options prior, like maybe a video walkthrough on the website. The staff was great. The restaurant's staff was great and food was good. There were a few things that could have been better, but it was still worth the stay. Property is nice and a great location."
My room was robbed and the casino hotel did nothing to reassure me or to make me feel safe not even offer in me a new room has not tracked down my stuff done nothing Help solve the problem Will not stay at the luxor casino ever again in my lifetime
Luxor hotel needs to be renovated.  It's dingy and broken down.  There are leaks everywhere and the rooms are not great.  the amenities are old and falling apart.  My toilet broke in half at the base and water was flooding the floor.  It was a hazzard and made for inconvenience.
"Guest room was poor quality.  Did not have basic things like coffee maker, mini fridge or microwave. Location is average.  Staff were friendly.  Casino was clean. Food court was mediocre, over priced and not very many options."
I was there for the PPAI expo and being my first experience there it was terrible the Mold smell in the room and hallway was just terrible. As soon as I got in the room there was a message saying the water was shut off. So I didn’t have water until I got back from the convention
"CES trip, was the cheapest option. Room had to be changed due to the smell of pot. Was given food credit as compensation, but couldn’t be used at food court. Tables were >$15 per hand and had limited variety. Buffet was average and forgettable"
"For the price the Luxor was fine. However, it is very out of the way and anything you really want to do is a pretty long walk. The mobile check-in and digital keys were nice and convenient. The Starbucks and Diablo Cantina were awesome. Our room was a little outdated. Our sink had issues draining and our A/C didn’t work half the time. Our outlets also struggled to hold any plugs such as my hair dryer, curling iron, and steamer. The plugs would just fall right out. The elevators also had issues–we had to get off and switch elevators several times and heard many other guests saying the same. The casino also has a stronger cigarette smell, and it was the only one in Vegas that we visited that I could strongly smell cigarettes. Personally, I would spend the extra money to be further down the strip."
"Before using anything in the room, make sure that the room has internet and cellular service. On a recent business trip, cellular did not work in a room accessed by the 1A elevator bank. I was moved to a room in the 2B elevator bank, and the service was better but spotty. There was often a bit of a wait for the elevators to arrive."
"We've stayed at LUXOR many times over the years and have seen the changes. The latest are good, except, as noted above, the mattress was too soft (and so were the pillows). The new room decor in our tower room was very nice and almost everything actually worked! Our room was clean. The hotel hallways, casino area, lobby - everything were also clean. I wish hotels would put a night stand on each side of the ed instead of just one side. It wold be so helpful to have an overnight phone charging location for each of the two of us."
We stayed at Luxor due to location to the conference we were attending. It was convenient and a great price. The staff were very helpful and nice. The hotel is a little dated and not as clean as it could be but overall we were happy with our experience. The execution of the theme is very good.  I would consider staying here again.
"This place is a dump, very old and tired with limited food options that are way over priced for what you get. Every where you look something needs fixing or painting. Inside of the elevators are very dirty."
"I have stayed at Luxor many times, I would NEVER stay in the pyramid, ONLY the towers.  If you stay in the pyramid you might as well stay at Excalibur and save some money.  The bathroom is a little janky, but it does the job."
"The front staff is rude and not helpful at all. They didn’t help when I asked for assistance for my elderly mother and myself when it came to checking in. They kept giving me an excused as to why our room was not ready and it took 8 hours later for our room to be ready. Also, our sink kept getting clogged even when it got “serviced”."
Payed more than was stated. Rooms were poor smelled like cigarettes carpet stained . Wasn’t as clean as it should of been.poor customer service wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. Price should of been cheaper for the quality.
"the room was clean, and the staff was extremely nice and helpful when I needed assistance. from the moment I got to the check in it was the easiest self-check in and I really like the keyless key on the app!"
"Between lack of communication between staff and security and the quality of restaurant food also going downhill, the only positive is that the Slot machines are currently up to date. Also Bell Service was amazing."
"Totally refreshed interior, central location. Enjoyed the selection of table games, especially the Fortune Blackjack and Ultimate Holdem.
Could have more video poker machines, but nice variety and not crowded."
"The Luxor provided a perfect spot for my trip to Vegas for CES. It has easy access to the strip. The room was nice. Not too fancy, but plenty big and clean. You can opt in or out of housekeeping. Parking is available for a fee."
Just a depressing property.  This place could be so nice if they invested into it.  I had black mold in my bathroom and lots of dust buildup around the bed frame. My suite upgrade was a bit nicer but still in major need of renovation. With some shag carpet it would have been 1972 all over again.
"We had a horrible experience at the Luxor. 

Checkin in the early hours of the morning took over an hour. The lady who served us on the front desk seemed very uninterested in assisting and oddly just did not seem in a good head space. She asked us no less than four times if we needed a car park among other repetitious questions. She was unknowledgeable on rooms and swung her screen round to show us the prices and then charged my Amex a totally different amount. When questioned she was unable to articulate why there was a difference and tried to negotiate on the hold amount per room. All very odd. It also struck us that there was a lot of time stalling on her part. It shouldn’t take 15 to 20 mins to check someone in. No wonder lines are so long

When we finally got to our room, we were greeted with a heavy tobacco odor, it was so strong you could actually see the smoke in the air. It was as if a large group of people had chain smoked in the room for a week. There’s no ability to open a window or ventilate in any way. We called to complain and switch room but we’re told to call back after 11 the next day as no rooms were available, even after pleading with them that my wife suffers severe allergies to smoke and it was a health risk for us. Eventually they sent someone who arrived around 3am to deodor our room. Not joking, his answer was to spray our room with a can of air freshener. When we asked him basic questions he said he had no idea and doesn’t usually work here?! 
Needless to say the next day we both woke up with headaches and the taste of tobacco in our mouths

After many failed attempts to actually connect with someone on the phone, and then refusing to wait in the queue for another hour we decided to give up and simply stay out of our room as much as we could. A hotel room (especially when I spent $2000 here) should at minimum be a place that offers a refuge and be comfortable. This room was anything but. 

Eventually we were able to get hold of someone who was able to swap out rooms. Too little too late. The lack of care, service, empathy, comfort and appreciation was sorely missing. 

My best advice is to consider spending more and staying elsewhere. We have visited Vegas many times and this property is in a league of its own. It’s an outlier in service and quality for all the wrong reasons. Further, we have come to expect a certain standard from MGM properties but the trust has gone there too. There are other very good options in Vegas"
The Luxor Hotel and Casino is a great place to stay with friendly staff and clean rooms. The unique setting is a must see and the casino and restaurants are excellent. The casino has the latest games and the restaurants have a variety for anyone’s taste.
The room and staff were wonderful.  The only thing that I missed was my room having a mini fridge and microwave.  Everything else was great with the room and my stay at the Luxor.  I would recommend staying at the Luxor to everyone who plans on taking a trip to wonderful Las Vegas!
Elevator wouldn’t register key but tried another elevator and the same key worked. Room smelled like smoke. There was a big broken tile in bathroom floor. Casino has a very old look. The whole place needs to be renovated.
"Staff at check in was extremely friendly.  Upgraded our room without us even asking. Room was slightly outdated, but bigger than expected with a nice soaking tub, however having a mini fridge was a huge bonus! Check out staff as extremely friendly as well.  
Only downside, little far from the rest of the strip, as well as the as alarms blaring in the hotel and rooms at 1:30 a.m. very startling. 
Overall pleasant stay!"
The Luxor is a five star in my book. It’s the hotel of choice for my friends and family due to the friendly service of the hotel staff. It has a relaxing atmosphere. Very comfortable clean rooms and great dining choices.
Took a short 3 night stay at Luxor upon arriving I felt weird like it was silly but after walking around and taking in the Luxor I began to appreciate it and enjoyed staying there. I would definitely book here again.
"I stayed at the Luxor with my family, and it was the most terrible experience. We got there and had to pay a resort fee even though we had already purchased a bundle. Which I would understand if it didn’t take an hour to leave every morning (people don’t understand how to pay for parking or leave facility and there was no attendant directing people), the escalators never worked, and the parking garage always looked like a mess. The rooms don’t have refrigerators so good luck keeping leftovers. Oh yeah, and we found a GIANT FLYING COCKROACH in our bathroom. I have a ton of pictures. The people who work there barely did anything, we got a new room but we were in there for days. No refund. And we got double charged for parking. DO NOT STAY AT LUXOR! Period, find somewhere else."
"I took my son to see the raiders game and this hotel was close by, to my surprise you can walk to the stadium through a bridge they close on game days and experience all the fans walking as well. This made it very convenient!"
This was my favorite between the Flamingo and Linq. I didn't give it an excellent because it didn't have a manual latch on the inside door. I like to utilize that latch for security as a hotel worker once gave my room and key to a guest- they walked right in (didn't happen here)!!!
Had the best time celebrating my 40th bday. They helped make our stay that much more enjoyable with a friendly check in and upgrade of room upon realization I was staying there to celebrate my birthday. Their service and kindness kicked off what went on to be a memorable experience for my wife and I. We will definitely return to Luxor based on this experience alone.
"Dirty rooms, burst water pipes, broken curtains, busted elevator indicators and tiles as well as broken door closers - all that just within what we saw from our one night stay at the Luxor. Alright for an emergency stay for a night (we had missed our flight), but in no way, shape or form the hotel you should pick for your authentic Vegas experience!"
"Not worth it. 
I don’t stay on the Vegas Strip often, this was my worst experience so far. We chose Luxor only because we went for the Blue Man Group and didn’t want to be out driving to a hotel in Vegas late at night. 
(The show itself was Fantastic! Fun, entertaining and family friendly!! Highly recommend!) 
Pros: 
-the VIP checkout man was very helpful and helped us checkout after we had problems with the auto checkout, even though we aren’t VIP. 
-convenience of staying where the Blue Man Group show plays 
-Room was generally clean
Cons:
-Lack of customer safety in the rooms. There is neither a deadbolt nor a hotel security latch on the door. The maid knocked and Entered our room at 9:38 even though checkout is 11am. She woke us and scared my children. Staff should not be able to enter a guest room without their permission, especially when it’s occupied. 
-check-in/out line is 20 minutes Minimum, morning and evening
-Room rate is advertised at $32 but by the time you add all the fees, taxes and extra resort fee it’s pushing $120. 
-On top of the room rate it is $18 per night to park 
-Basic amenities in a typical hotel room are only available for extra charge (ie mini fridge)  
-Room is in need of repair, has large area of peeling wallpaper near the window 
-hair in the sheets

The bottom line is it’s just not worth the money unless you are there to gamble? I won’t ever stay on the Strip again. It’s worth the 10 minute drive to stay at a typical hotel whose aim is to please the customer and provide a great quality experience rather than just get you in the door to play the slots."
I surprised my man for his Solar Return a trip to Vegas. I chose the Luxor because of it representation of the pyramids from Egypt. They also have a Kong Tut experience as well within. It's next to being in Egypt  .
"Let's start with the positives. 1) Sam at the front desk was excellent. 2)The rumors online say that Luxor may face demolition in the near future  (If you don't understand why i put that in the positives category think, again. 3) It was cheap to stay there. 4) The bed was comfortable. 

Now for the negatives. 1)  The hotel room was dated 2) The valet parking was so understaffed and took so long to drop of your car or retrieve it that the staff constantly (and sincerely) apologized for the long delays and blamed it on management's decision to cut back on staff 3) The buffet gets a good rating for quantity of food but the quality was awful. I've had better food at McDonalds 4) Getting a problem fixed was a joke (a bad joke). 5) If you are an MGM gold or above ""member"" they hand you a card with a special phone number to call if you have any problems at all. It would have been a nice touch if someone ever answered the phone! It's a week after our stay and I'll be the phone is still ringing.  6) I learned years ago that problems usually start at the top of a company. The staff here seemed overworked, drained but tried their best, but it was obvious  at every turn that the whole system there is broken.  

Bottom line, if you are looking for a cheap room on the strip and go in with low expectations, then this hotel will be ok. Think of it as being on the level of Circus Circus or Excalibur. Wait, maybe I should apologize to Circus Circus and Excalibur."
Rooms given are very old and not maintained well. Need to walk lot and no clear instructions for finding places inside. No minimal courtesy by room service to knock door and wait for response. Over all disappointed with the stay. Faced shower issue on 2nd day of stay.
"I had a wonderful time during my stay at the Luxor. From the start it was very easy checking in, all I had to do was check in from my phone and my room was ready before the normal check in time of 3 pm. Rooms are clean."
"Rooms were bad quality,  dirty, trashy beat up furniture.Beds were good,  plenty of hot water..no blankets..safe didn't work, carpet was tripping me, broken lamps, bulbs not working, dresser drawers bad"
The property is still recovering from the pandemic. The pool is closed during the winter months. I did find the Pyramid is quieter than the towers. As the towers have street noice and the Pyramid does not.
"We called the front desk and as soon as I said my question they hung up on me- u tried to call again and no one picked up. We had late checkout and got about 3 emails telling us not to forget to checkout at 11 which were annoying but we assumed automatic (even if I believe they should have a program that would automatically send email with the late checkout time)- this was whatever but then we cleaning lady came knocking why we were still there at 12:00- she was confused but nice when we told her we had late checkout- we just didn’t like that there was no communication letting her know. The room has no fridge, or coffee maker which is usually standard in hotel rooms but it was my bad for missing that when booking just a little heads up. It was clean and a nice room but the way they communicated was an inconvenience. I don’t think we would stay again since there are so many other options in Vegas."
"It was a very friendly enviroment and the stall is really nice , the restauranta are very good, they have a lot of good casino games. Since i like gambling alot is a good place to find a lil bit of everything. Thanks"
"Our room had a smell that emanated from the bathroom. It smelled like a dirty hot tub. We let it go for the first night we were there, but the 2nd day it was worse. I mentioned it to the staff who put in a maintenance request to have it resolved. They were very friendly and told me that if nothing could be done about it they would move us. No one ever contacted me or updated me on the situation. I checked in 2 more times and they had no updates. We were not moved and nothing was done about the smell. Pretty gross."
"Lets starts by saying that the rooms are outdated, there is a bad cigarette smell even in their corner suites, water clogs in the showers & sinks, baggage claim is not prompt or professional, check in process takes a long time with staff, and the parking prices are outrageous."
"Had a blast! Luxor was affordable, clean, renovated, great staff. Can’t wait to go back. Tenders steak house has great food. The cafe also had good selections. Lots of fun slots and table games. Good live music as well"
"Pretty bad hotel. Luxor is just too outdated. For the amount you pay, you would expect better quality. 800 for a suite room with aging furniture and popcorn ceiling with a cigarette smell doesn’t scream luxury to me. Tv is very old and they lock the hdmi ports so you won’t be able to stream anything. Even aria allows this.

Barely any toiletries provided, just simple shampoo and bar soap. Nothing fancy like in a suite at the Bellagio or Cosmo.

Again the room is just too old, mismatched furniture and it’s not very functional."
"The furniture is long overdue for replacement. The room could have been cleaner. Very poor job vacuuming and dusting. There was NO refrigerator, microwave or coffee maker. They only provided shampoo, no conditioner."
"it was okay but my room smelled like cigarettes . but it isn’t a bad hotel overall i would say it’s pretty good compared to other hotels, but the elevators are kinda scary. but i would stay again. they have some nice exhibits. ALSO it’s affordable compared to other hotels around."
Elevators would stop at every other floor on the way downstairs and that was really annoying seeing as how we were on the 10th floor. My room smelled like the little league football team was staying there & there was ash on just about every table in the room. Staff was very helpful & friendly & everything thing else in the hotel was great to experience
I’ve stayed at this location many times. I prefer to stay in the Towers vs. Pyramid. The towers are quiet and extremely clean. I’ve never experienced an issue. I just wish there was a quicker way to get to the strip!
"Although it was cheap on going on first week of January of the new year, but it is still a walk from Luxor to the MGM monrail station. Wifi connects up to two devices (from what I experience). Can't complain of the pool if its empty since it is kind of chill to even go outside. Room was exceptionally clean once arrive and experience no problems so far."
Great place to stay! Will definitely come back. Nice buffet. Nice staff. Good location. Nice bed. Fair rate. There should not be a minimum of character in order to leave a good review on TripAdvisor. :-)
"Sprinkler heads appeared moldy, outlets are looser then the slots, nothing stays plugged in. Hot water and a/c worked when it wanted to. Floor and walls were dirty. Beds were clean. Check in was brutal and not enough staffing. Casino was great. Will look elsewhere for room to stay in next trip."
"Almost everything in the hotel that my colleagues and I had to use was busted. I rarely complain about anything but this was pretty bad.

1. Elevators in “Elevator 2” corner were all sorts of dismay. One elevator would always stop at floor 8 and/or 9 and also wouldn’t close the door until the “timelimit” was hit. I literally kept on shaking the entire side panel on another elevator which made a loud noise / allowed me to see the wall behind it moving. The best looking elevator out of them all had a camera missing. Panels for controls / wiring were either hanging open or missing completely. Elevator button on our floor (13) didn’t work on one side. Everything creeked to the extreme.

2. Couldn’t get out of the parking garage with hotel key. Had to constantly use the help button and give someone my hotel room number. Was told could come to front desk to get key to get in and out but lines were always long at the front desk.

3. We didn’t notice till the last day when cleaning up the room but there were a pair of black panties underneath the sofa chair in the room. We were all men inside the room :)

4. Escalators kept on going in and out of order.

5. Doors to parking garage are supposed to automatically open when walking towards them. One of them stopped midway and colleague ran into it.

6. All lights in room would flicker very randomly.

7. Outlet that was supposed to be embedded into the wall was hanging out.

8. No fridge in room unless u “rent” it.

9. TV volume would default to “30” whenever you first adjusted it from turning it on. Not helpful when your friends are already sleeping.

Every staff member I ran into / talked to was helpful. Unfortunately this was my friend’s first experience in vegas and this was not a good place to start. This also isn’t my first time staying here so was surprised on how bad everything was."
"Hotel location is not the best but still ok, walk from elevator to room was very far, staff always pleasant, casino is nice but walking escalators seem to always be broken every visit. Good food selection in stores late when most things closed."
Room didn’t have a mini fridge. You have to request/rent it. No coffee maker. Don’t expect to have a nice view….it’s difficult to see out their windows due to a metal mess. Elevators need better upkeep and maintenance.
"I've only stayed at the Luxor, for 4 trips now. It's only gone down hill. I have real concerns about the cleanliness of the rooms. Sharp shards of glass on my bathroom floor that weren't cleaned after a cleaning was requested. This mirrored my last trip where I was given an unclean room. I'm willing to bet the glass is still on the floor as of this review."
"Leaky pipes and a hole in the roof outside our room, broken elevators that either didn't recognize your room key, the TV was hard set at a max volume of 25 of 75 so it was nearly impossible to hear. Loud guests in the halls at night shouting"
My experience there wasn’t as expected. Had to get food and couldn’t warm it up. I couldn’t keep food cold so I wasted more money. My experience could’ve been better. I had fun but spent too much money.
"This hotel and casino has gone down so much, it makes me sad to see how unclean the rooms and entire hotel was, we stayed a week and never saw or heard vacuums it smelled funny and it was extremely muggy in the rooms and Hallways you can tell the difference being in other places on the strip. There are noticeable cracks all along the ceilings also. The elevators were rocky and felt unbalanced and the carpets have waves in them that someone can trip on. Wouldn’t recommend. I would pay more to stay somewhere else more comfortable wouldn’t stay again if anyone decides to stay here I would highly recommend you check out at a checkout desk and make sure that your charges are correct"
Shower was almost unusable - major points deduction. Modern flat screen TV with an ancient cable box attached. Looks awful! The beds were comfortable. No in-room refrigerator - looks like they have been removed and you need to rent them?
"The Luxor is looking dates these days. I used elevator 3A and it is very banged up. No USB charger in room, TV reception was poor. Service was very good however. The price of food in the food court was insane. Hallway noise in the wee hours of the morning was an issue."
"Over all definatly staying somewhere else next time for the price we paid the stay was less then satisfactory, no fridge no microwave, no coffee didn't get told about the breakfast so we missed that the whole week. Bartenders charge what ever they want and don't stick with the same price."
"Rooms are good for the price and the location is good.  Valet parking is a ripoff.  I stayed 2 nights, probably spent $2500 on the property and still had to pay $60 for valet parking all while being a Pearl member.  There are much better casino options on other properties."
"Came in to our room and smelled like cigarette smoke. Guest services said they don’t have smoking room, so we weren’t moved to a different room but instead they sent someone to our room to spray the carpet and A/C with chlorine/bleach smelling freshener."
"I stayed at the hotel for eight nights even prepaid for my reservation. Housekeeping knocked on my door several times to inform that I was listed as a “rush” checkout DESPITE my prepaid reservation. I attempted to speak with the manager about the situation and Martin was EXTREMELY  rude even hung up on me several times. The shower also does not drain properly so it fills up with water while showering. The television freezes a lot and management blames it on hotel network traffic. Valet is downright rude regardless of the gratuity. Some of the housekeeping staff will lie claim they’re coming back to clean the room but you seldom return. The tour desk staff will lie about timeshare incentives then they’re nasty when you bring it to their attention. I will say however, Jesus was nice manager who genuinely seemed to care about guest. Whereas, managers like Martin is emotionally abusive! Chicken and waffles at the Pyramid Cafe is burnt majority of the days. Martin just really made the guest relations a horrific experience."
"Luxor is the best place to stay in the strip easy to get to and from
Without long wait lines during New Years. Great place to stay die
Checking in with there Mobile check in no long wait times for me or my guest ."
"I stayed here because it was cheaper than most and now I know why. Shower head was filthy, corners of shower are never cleaned. Noise coming from wall kept my girl up for two nights(water pipes shaking). We opted out for no room service and someone still came into our place twice and cleaned. Buffet was terrible and was $40. I’d rather eat McDonald’s. As much as the staff is friendly and nice they need a nice place to call home and Luxor isn’t it."
My stay was ok. It was hard to find my room thanks to the security lady that helped me.the walk to the room from parking was long as hack. Parking cost was high and hard to figure it out to pay to get out.
"4 hour check in room!!! Worse ever!!!! Dirty room, still a had mess from last guest! Including dirty towels, toiletries and garbage!! And still got charged for a full night and didn’t get a clean room until 4am!! Never will stay there again"
"We arrived on December 28th, 2022 for the New Year but the room upgrade we were able to get made us extend twice or departure! We left on January 5 instead 2nd! The corner suite with a mini refrigerator and the bath tub by the sky window was very unexpected and appreciated! We will go back."
Broken equipment (elevator) no ability to move around resort without horrible delays. (I use a mobile chair). Untrained or uncaring managers and staff. I use MGM on every stay and this is first time I have had a bad experience. Luxor's building and staff are the worst I ever seen in MGM properties.
"Staff are friendly but the hotel has lots of problem when compared with paid price. First, the lights in the room were not work properly. Second, the room direction sign is not correct, and that will make you walk for a great circle to get your room. Last is parking for guest is worse than parking for non-guest. The information on their website is not matched with the staff saying. So, make sure that you ask them clearly before you check out."
Check is a little slow (like all LV hotels) but everything afterward was good. The room was reasonably priced and clean and well-maintained. Hotel has good connection to Mandalay Bay which makes a good choice of shops and restaurants.
"I have stayed at Luxor for decades as a players card member.  Never again!  The hotel has not been maintained and MGM is charging junk fees on just about everything.  Parking is very expensive and so are the resort fees.  I was comped a room and would still not return after all the fees and issues.  TV did not work, shower drain was plugged, semen stains were on bed skirts, mold in windows, etc.  Requests for repair and correction were never completed.  I will take my gaming elsewhere and would like a refund of the fees paid."
"Stayed for a family vacation for a week between xmass and new year's, which was our second visit in the last two months. Recommend tower suits are they are newer. Love the mobile check in and the ability to do everything on the mobile app. The price was very reasonable, and the stay was comfortable."
"Our room was clean but a bit of a walk from the elevator. All of the staff was very friendly, especially at the front desk. We enjoyed the tram and liked that we could walk to T-Mobile Arena for a hockey game."
I’m a gold member didn’t even get a free upgrade room the front desk doesn’t even smile her service was poor. I will never come back to this hotel again that I don’t feel welcome. I asked for tower room and she just said there’s no available with attitude.
"This hotel is a joke. Stay anywhere else. Terrible experience. Location is good but there are so many others to choose from, pick another one. I have had better experiences staying at budget hotels like red roof inn. Stay away!"
"The room was cold, the bathroom fixtures were all corroded, someone had tampered with the smoke detector. It looked like it had been covered with wet toilet paper. I got charged more than double what this room normally cost because a CES convention was in town. I have had nicer rooms at a super 8. 19th floor and you have to go all the way to 1 for a cup of coffee. The only reason I didn’t gave it one star was because the Blue Man Group Show was so outstanding. I just wish I stayed somewhere else and came over to see it."
I did not like the parking. It was entirely too far. Hotel staff did not help with directions to my room further adding to my frustration. I ordered food to my room and the hotel did not let the driver in. I was told I had to come downstairs to get my food at the main entrance. The staff did not telle her name or give me directions as to how to get to where she was and rudely hung up the phone. I never found the staff or my food. I was livid. I have no intention of staying here again. I will stay elsewhere when I come back to town next month. The staff definitely needs customer service training. This was a horrible experience to say the least.
"Stayed at the Luxor because of the good rates. The hotel is fine if you are 25 and partying on the strip all night and can sleep through a warzone. The rooms are clean, and many are getting remodeled. Hotel isn't bad but it seems to attract a clientele that is looking for cheap and just need to sleep of night of drunken debauchery.  If that is not your scene any more than go next door to MB. It costs more but you will be able to sleep."
We stayed for one night.  Check-in was a bit long. Please download their app for quicker check-in. We loved our two queen bed room overlooking the view of Mandala Bay. The beds were so soft and comfortable. Everything you need for a short stay was available. We recommend staying here.
"The staff is wonderful. Aside from the managers and front desk staff. Was never told, or given any information whatsoever regarding anything in the hotel, the location of it, prices, nothing. You had to stop at a desk and feel pressured to buy some thing just to get information and had I not seen them? There are three major exhibit I would’ve never known about because they do not advertise them nor offer guests any incentive to go. Also not having room service at such a big hotel was kind of a bummer. But be prepared to spend money because the cheapest meal is about $20 anywhere you go breakfast lunch or dinner"
"The Luxor was an excellent choice, I’ll be coming back in June for my birthday and already have my room booked .. excellent Food courts/restaurants and slot Machines as well and a spacious and clean room."
"Overall, a great value based on location, quality of the hotel, and price. I was able to secure a regular rate room at the Luxor cheaper than discounted business and government rates elsewhere OFF the strip. For the money (about $75 a night), it couldn’t be beat."
Not enough value for the price. Elevators are scary and the layout of the property is frustrating. You can only access your floor from one bank of elevators so going to and from the room is a hassle. Facilities are run down. They alway timeshare scammers to rent a desk right up front to harass guests and the keycards are unreliable
"Far enough away to be able to relax from expo stuff, close enough to not be a problem getting to expo, fairmont st experience... good stay. probably would stay again for future business travel. Tower rooms are more convenient and spacious than main building stay due to architechture but nice. Biggest convenience is access to excalibur and mandala bay through walking bridges."
Softball Tournament  a College Showcase for my daughter . I was very uncomfortable staying there just the one night. I would not recommend bringing any young children or teenagers to The Luxor . Please be careful there especially in the elevator
"When my brother and I booked this hotel I was a bit skeptical as I heard some bad reviews but decided to put it past us since you never know what somebody's experience was. When we arrived to the hotel, the gentleman at the desk was not very friendly. Check in was quick which was nice. We got into our room and the floors are so old and outdated and have stains all over it. The cleanliness was subpar. The location is not great if you are looking to go into the heart of the strip as it is at the complete end. We did not spend much time at the actual hotel besides sleeping. Our last night we decided to go to the flight bar and play a game and grab a drink. We cashed out and walked back towards our room (west tower) my brother ran outside and while he did that I waited for him in the lobby. After the lobby we went back up to our room. At this point I realized my wallet was missing. I tore apart my room thinking maybe I put it in a spot other than my purse. It was nowhere to be found. I went down to security and explained my last steps of the night and that I knew I had the wallet at the bar but believe it may have fallen out and most likely stolen, as I had significant amount of cash in it and it was a higher end wallet. When I went to security, the woman was rude and did not want to be bothered. She basically told me that it was my fault that I abandoned it and there's nothing they could do. I asked her if they could check security footage as I was flying back home that evening and needed my ID. She then told me that is not in her jurisdiction and nothing could be done. As my day went on I froze my debit card and hoped to hear from security but nothing was found. I was able to get on my flight and as I am sitting waiting for us to take off I received a notification from my credit card as well as my Venmo card that I was charged $1.34 ""PBC-Las Vegas"" at this point I was on a plane and not in possession of these cards whatsoever. I looked up the charge and it seems to be for a vending machine and there is another story of a woman losing her wallet at the Luxor and 3 hours later that charge happening. Overall the security and management of this hotel is a joke and its unprofessionalism like this that will ruin a business. Do not recommend!! Spend the extra money elsewhere."
Bed bugs all over me the next day. Had to go get ointments for treatment. Hookers propositioning me around my entry into my room. I just wasn’t comfortable entering and exiting my room. Very frustrating with the whole stay.
"This hotel was dirty and very outdated. There was a hole in our window (on the 11th floor) that leaked a large puddle onto our carpet when it rained. Because there was a hole in the window, we also were woken up by sirens in the morning. There are VERY few amenities. No coffee, have to pay for a refrigerator, and just overall an unkept hotel. The elevators take forever and the floors of the elevator waiting areas, the elevator doors and walls were filthy. The hotel really needs a deep clean."
"Rooms are stuck in the 90's. Tub was dirty when I got in the room as was the shower. Had to clean it myself. Walk from room to elevator was an additional 5 minutes. Wait for elevator is between 3-5 minutes. If you need to say somewhere cheap and don't care about the room itself go for it. If you're looking for somewhere nice, this isn't the place for you."
"Luxor is one of our favorite properties now for staying in Vegas.  We come for the hockey games, so it's fairly easy access via walking to the arena.  The cost of staying at Luxor is far more affordable than other MGM properties.  The newly renovated rooms in the pyramid are quite nice.  The tower rooms and suites are getting dated, but still quite nice, especially for the price point.  There's a buffet and great food onsite.  There's also the shops along the way to Mandalay Bay with some food options there.  Easy indoor walking to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay, and the outdoor tram, makes this a good spot.  The tram can get you to the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd.  Easy access from there to NYNY, Tropicana, and MGM Grand."
There was no resolution and I was very disappointed. My stay was for 4 days and I checked out after just staying one day. I will never go back there horrible experience. Management was terrible in resolving the issue and provided no help.
"I went to Luxor with low expectations but the hotel and casino definitely changed my mind. Ee had a great time and great food there, nothing over the top but delicious and what we needed. Definitely will be back."
You get what you pay for!! I didn't pay much because of MGM rewards but I sure got my monies worth. Luxor was a great place to stay for the value and the attractions inside. Will definitely consider staying again!!
Got in from a late flight only to find our room didn't have a working toilet or cold water and the water was black! We were moved to another room and the entire bathroom was stained with some black ink and this was supposed to be a premium room but didn't feel like it at all! They gave us a $50 credit that we couldn't even use because all of the restaurants were closed overnight -_____-
No response from lost and found.  My view from my room was a concrete wall.  Noisy guests from 2:00-4:00 AM on multiple nights kept us awake.  Shower corrosion made me think I was on the coast and not in the desert.
"We booked on your site ( not 3rd party )
Spa room city view. We got 2nd floor No view. We asked if our family members can get same rooms. That showed available on YOUR SITE not 3rd party. And the staff declined. 
Thank You Luxor MOTEL."
"We checked into our room, and the toilet seat was broken, the tv didn't work, and the iron didn't work either. We called the front desk, and the person said someone would go up and fix it. I called the front desk three hours later since I was still waiting for someone to fix the issues. They told me to call back tomorrow because they were busy. I said this was unacceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. A supervisor gave us a new room in the west tower. The room was filthy. There was trash on the carpet, and there appeared to be blood stains on the bed sheets. It was late, and I was too tired to call back. The next day I asked them to change the sheets and vacuum. They didn't change the sheets or vacuum, we just got new towels, so I had to call back again. When they did send someone up, she smelled very strongly of marijuana. I know it's legal, and I don't have an issue with it, but I have a problem with her bringing the smell to my room, not to mention her being high. It would be like smelling like alcohol, it's legal, but it doesn't mean you get drunk and go to work. That was just the room review. The casino and food court were so below average. It is one of those casinos that smells old, dusty, and smoky, and you start getting headaches."
"We were here in January 2023 so the weather was cool and outdoor pools were closed.  In addition to the prepaid hotel fees, we were charged $18 per day to park a car [and charged for 4 days even though I had the car for 2 and had to wait in line for 30 minutes to ask them to correct that] and $35 per day RESORT FEES.  I asked what the resort fees covered and was told:  the pool [closed for winter], free local calls [we all have cell phones, no one uses a hotel phone for anything anymore], printing your plane boarding pass [again, we have that on our phones or can print at the airport], oh and free wi-fi.   I objected saying these so-called amenities might have been great in 1992 but are meaningless now.  She said, well you can use the fitness center.  Yes, because everyone goes to Vegas to use the fitness center.  A piece of pizza in the food court was $15, a Bud was $15 at the food court and $9 in the bar.  C'mon.  All that was annoying but then I got in the elevator.  The maintenance access door in one of the elevators was hanging by a hinge, another was held on by a piece of tape, another had wires hanging out and the 4th had no door and gang graffiti all over it.  THIS is what they call a RESORT? I complained and asked the manager when was the last time he looked at the elevator.  He said they regularly maintain it.  I said I've been here since Wednesday and it's Saturday and no one has fixed those doors or cleaned those elevators.  I was then told that they keep a nice hotel and that it's the guests who tear it up!  The place reeks of cigarettes and cigars and to compensate when you walk into your room, you are smacked with overwhelming air freshener. The room was ok, but just a standard hotel room.  This was my first time to Vegas.  It was for my husband's birthday.  He had great memories of Vegas and was really disappointed in the hotel.  The thing is, after getting fleeced that first night, we never spent one dime in the hotel.  We left every day and went down the strip to other places, ate and drank and gambled elsewhere, and only slept at the Luxor.  Had they treated us better, we might have stuck around.  I would never recommend this place.  It is NOT a resort and is at best a mediocre hotel. Go further down the strip where your business is better appreciated."
Check-in procedure was super simple - done right on my phone.  No need for standing in lines.  Room was ready early.  Corner room was really nice and great view and very large room!  Very happy with stay overall.
"Like l said before the room smell like humidity , and cigarettes. Other than that we like staying at Luxor there are lots of bars, restaurants, stores and the staff is very friendly. You do have to pay for valet parking"
"MGM is the only properties I will stay at in Vegas. Live the food  service,  and the rooms are always great . Always a good time in the casinos, dealers and pit bosses are always helpful. Never had a bad time at any MGM property
."
My total for a 4 night stay was supposed to be $543 but When I went to check I’n I was told my new total was $713 so I really felt like I was lied to and when I told them that my total was supposed to be $543 all they did was say it says her that it’s $713 and was never really given and explanation as to why the rate changed
"The Hotel was probably amazing at one time, but it definitely is showing it’s age. The check in app did not work for us, so we still had to stand in line. The elevators are a bit sketchy to ride. It’s an ok place to stay"
"When we checked into the suite, there was fecal matter smeared on the front of the toilet.  When housekeeping was alert and requested to service the room (with NO ‘do not disturb sign’ on the door…they skipped the room and ignored the request."
"rooms has not coffee maker, not refri, not glasses. the tv control has not batteries so you cant no used the tv , they want to save energy.
i called for the batteries nobody come, i had to get them by myself"
Had a good time at the hotel. Check in was long as mobile check in wouldn’t work for me.  Had a good room was clean and spacious. Hotel was easy to get around and had adequate dining. Went to see the blue man group was a very good show. Would rate this hotel better than expected and was good value for the money.
"This was such a bad experience unfortunately. We upgraded to get a bigger room. It was noisy. Downgraded and got a more noisy room. Upgraded again and got punished with the most dirty room. Then I asked it to be cleaned and was asked if I did it my self. There were chips and peanuts/nuts on the floor and I have nut allergi. There was a strangers hair in the sink and the ceiling had a whole in it. Looks like it is going to fall down. There is dirt in the ventilator in the bathroom and in the aircon. We can’t heat up the room which is freezing, due to the very bad smell coming from it. I was told the cleaners might not have time to come and clean. I was told I could always find another hotel with my family if I was not happy. The manager didn’t have time to come and talk to me and have a look at the pictures from the room.  Maybe they thought we just wanted something extra which we didn’t want. We honestly just wanted to have fun, a nice clean room and go gamble. I was almost crying when I was accused to make the mess myself. Felt like we paid more to be punished.  I wouldn’t ask people to stay in this hotel, and we have one more night we can’t get out of."
"stayed in the pyramid, best stay ever at Luxor.  loved the slanted windows but the view was better.  Room was clean, staff friendly and the wonkavator was great.  Would stay again easily.  The only downside is the buffet, not worth the price but the deli had the best Italian sandwiches I have ever had."
"Staff was amazing , only issues was elevator not working that goes from food court to downstairs. Only one elevator connects those levels. Just a bet upsetting since we have a stroller / wagon. Which made process a bit more challenging."
The staff was very professional and were all amazing to talk with and work with because when we checked it there was a lot of people and the staff was so professional and quick with answering questions and personal while trying to get all guests checked in as quick as possible.
Had an awesome experience. Staff was very nice and helpful loved the service made everything so easy. Rooms nice and clean. Definitely going back again. Plus close to strip and raiders stadium. Thank you Luxor and staff for the awesome and fun experience
In our hallway to our room was a huge dumpster under a huge hole in the ceiling. Then mold in the shower. Wallpaper falling/peeling off in the hallways. The key pads every now and then work with your phone. Try and use the key they give u and still doesn’t work. Had to get off one elevator to go one another because we couldn’t get the key to work to go to our floor.
The Stay was good. Check in took 30 min due to long lines. The bed was really good. The rooms was kind of old with no fridge. The bathroom was clean but didn't have a bath tub. Please renovate the rooms in the Pyramid.
Could only Mobil check in one room of 2. Had to stand in long line to get second room. Took up 3-5 minutes to get hot water for shower. Also sink took as much time to get the hot water in order to shave.
We had a horrible experience from not being safe and protected by the security team and being rationally characterized for being person of color. First they were told there was an argument with people and security right away came and surrounded our table which they assume it was our table because we black people. When they realized it was 2 table down from us. The second incident a Homeless guy tried to steal my brothers phone security took for ever to come out to us and when they finally did the assistant manager of the security told us they knew who the homeless guy was because he is not allowed in the hotel/casino but yet they allow him to still come in and walk around the hotel/casino. How are we supposed to feel safe and protected when they can stop one guy from coming in and stop him from stealing from costumers.
"I expected a 5 star hotel for $500 usd but got a 2 star, room unclean and dust gathered beside bed and floor not vacuumed.  Furnishings are shabby and old.  Overpriced and I feel cheated.  Had to wait 1 hr for valet parking when checking in and 1 hr upon check out.  Had to wait in line to check in so add another 40 min...took almost 2 hrs before we got our key."
"The inside structure of Luxor is very impressive even 30 years after. Very laid back environment and different entertainment (like bodies, Titanic, and Tutankhamen) experience. If you don't mind walking, is just 20 minutes walk from the strip center."
"Uncleaned rooms with unfriendly service. Staff felt did not want to be at work. Had turd floating in toilet, Could have used better trained staff and management. Would pass on this hotel in the future......."
I waited on the phone for ten minutes for house keeping just so the lady hung up on me she did not want to hear me.over all was ok but I will not stay there again my wife and I did not like the experience .
"Although the casino area was packed the room was quiet, comfortable and clean. We were only in town for Adele New Years Eve concert and Vegas regardless was filled with people. But we didn’t have an issue checking in on the app and checking out as well."
I been there plenty of times I never had an issue. Similar to that day. I feel the quality has gone down that used to be my best get away hotel instead of these high end casinos. I love the vibe there the People but after this stay I feel like I will considered  some where else .
"Perfect location, the hotel overall was just perfect! From the ease of checking in to upgrading our rooms, to the buffet and pyramid cafe. Everything was good, no complaints at all. Really appreciated the excellent customer service from the receptionist who checked us in!"
The resort was not as clean as it used to be amenities are less also no toilet paper in the casino bathroom the staff was ok overall…………the mandalay was pure trash the drinks were weak and expensive half the moving walkways don’t work
"I stayed at the Luxor on business and the guest room was very comfortable, always clean and there were plenty of towels.  I would recommend Luxor as an option for anyone attending a convention or meeting at Mandalay."
"For all the money this property takes in you would think that they could make basic repairs. An old water leak through the ceiling had left the drywall tape stained, split and hanging loose. Marks/tears on walls, counter tops and furniture also showed age. Every door in the suite creaked. Convenient location was a plus though."
"My second stay at Luxor and had a Tower room, very nicely updated and comfortable and a large tub and shower as well. Room was quiet at night and I enjoyed the ease of getting coffee in the morning. Valet was also quick to retrieve my car even when they were obviously swamped. The sandwich shop at back of casino by sports book is also a good place to eat, I highly recommend."
"The Luxor is nice.  The room was clean and free of problems.  The elevators can be a little confusing and my key card for the elevator didn't work quite right.  There was a long line to check in, but that's Vegas for you.  This property is nice and close to the airport."
It was nice to stay by the stadium but the hotel amenities and elevator service left much more to be desired.  Having to wait over 15 minutes for an elevator seems unreasonable.  Especially when you clearly can hear that no other elevator in that quad is running.
"The room was dingy and outdated. Room had carpet stains, uncomfortable beds, dusty closet and drawers. Door handles sticky. Bathroom tub dusty with stains… I do have to say that the downstairs deli had the best double cheeseburgers…."
This is a great location and property if you are attending a Mandalay Bay Convention.  The walk is easy and the shops along the way interesting and useful.  The staff is helpful and always in good spirits.  My only complaint is that the table minimums are too high in off-peak hours.
"bathtub was broken , I arrived in my room there were no bath towels or hygiene products, I had to call and ask, I paid early check in and my room was not ready, bad service at all, change for Aria resorts and casino"
"I had to moved to three different rooms because of issues with maintenance and cleanliness. I noticed long dark hair in the shower stalls and tub from previous guests. Seemed like there were a lot of water leaks because of recent rain, including in one of the rooms I stayed in. The staff is awesome though and very friendly."
Nice hotel all good except service in the bar in front of the reception desk that I ordered a drink for my wife from the menu and was told they did not serve from the menu during the game football games. Within 5 min a two young ladies ordered from the menu and they served them drinks from the menu. Right in front of me did not think it was to profesional on their behalf
"Hotel Room Theft/Premise liability - Staying at the newly renovated East Tower at Luxor has been a horrible experience. When we walked in I noticed that on the hand towel there was a dark hair and then stuff left over in the bathroom. I wouldn't have complained about these little mishaps, BUT as we left our room unattended for 2-2.5 hours it was broken into. 

How was it broken into? Well, someone had to have used a key. This room is located near the stairs and exit. This must have made this hallway or us clear targets. Security was involved and we filled out a report. Hotels know who badges into rooms. Housekeeping came down and shared that none of their staff entered our room. Several items were stolen and this person with a key walked out with a backpack with numerous personal belongings, several charges and cables, battery packs, and cash. 

Staff also have not been cordial about this issue. Housekeeping prior to a lady coming down to give us food and beverage vouchers was rude on the phone and accused of of stating it was there staff when there housekeeping cart was found outside our door. Who else has the capacity to enter our room unattended, so we were just stating that someone with a key came into our room and ransacked it and left with our belongings with no consequences from Luxor. This I believe would be considered premises liability as Luxor allowed someone with a key to go into a room of a guest and allow theft to occur. 

Engineering also came by to double check the door and said that the door closed correctly and no one physical broke in and that it is suspected a person with a room key broke into the room. 

Please think twice before you stay here at Luxor......theft can occur in your locked room while you're away. This happened between a 2-2.5 hour window so we almost feel like we were targeted."
Rain water from a heavy downpour started to leak from the window and light socket (which is an electrical issue). Water fell on to the desk and very likely ruined my laptop. Will have to take it to an Apple Store once I’m back home for inspection.
"Elevators didn’t work, room was from 1950, STUNK of cigarette smoke, staff was okay at best, obviously who ever owns the Luxor has no concerns towards their customers and their stay. We will never be back."
"Overall this hotel is decent if you get it a cheap rate, we stayed 4 nights in mid-December, the World Rodeo finals were in town that week along with UFC so there was not a shortage of things to do. The rooms are very dated and have weird smoke smell, but fairly clean with that they can be, the housekeeping staff was in everyday with no issues, we had a check in issue, but it was rectified by Pasqual, a great employee, we did have a pyramid suite, it has a sitting room, mini fridge 2 queen beds and a jacuzzi. We did have issues with he water pressure and hot water, that did not get rectified, but it is what it is. We didn't spend much time in the room, the casino floor is decent, would be ideal to filter out the smoke smell with a better ventilation system. We had a couple meals at the playbook restaurant, decent pub food with great service. we sat at the bar by the elevator 1 a couple awesome bartenders and 2 other ones (not so much) the biggest problem is its at the opposite side of the strip and not much goes on in this area, its a decent spot if you just want to play at the casino and not really leave the resort, you are somewhat in a weird part of the strip."
"The resort is a nice place to visit, however, I would not stay in the hotel again.  The rooms are way to pricey for what you get.  There was no fridge nor microwave in room at all.  If you wanted a fridge, you had to rent it."
"Nobody answers the damn phone, from Spa to concierge, restaurant to font desk. Youll be put on hold forever. Ive tried calling for three days straight. NOBODY EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE! It was so ridiculous!"
"What could have happened in 2 days in Las Vegas to lose that much ? 

It's not what you think. Our room have been stolen while we were away. Staff member ? Bad door security ? Nobody knows as their is no cameras on the whole floor. Expert came to examine the door: Somebody did enter before we went back in. Officer confirm THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SECURITY ISSUE. check pictures.

And who's fault is this ? Apparently not Luxor who throw you from security services to guest services before you finish your sentence on the phone. Hopefully, they are very sorry that we lost 10 000$ worth of goods and wish us the best for this New Year.

Just glad nobody was in the room during the thief so nobody got hurt from this.

Besides: Except additional fees and our rooms wasn’t cleaned once.

Las Vegas is great overall, they are plenty of other hotel in the Strip. Luxor location and pyramid are impressive and enjoyable. The feeling in the casino is not animated as the Caesar palace, Excalibur or the Strat for example.

Would NOT recommend Luxor for SECURITY and ATMOSPHERE reasons."
Our stay was for the NFL Raiders vs Chiefs game on Saturday. We had a blast at the game and then back to the Luxor to party & play! Staff was great we played all types of games including three card poker ( that was a lot of fun ) so yes I will recommend staying here to all my family and friends!
"For a 4 star hotel, they charged
$25 for a refrigerator in the hotel room
$25 for a manual wheelchair for my disabled daughter, it is provided as a courtesy in all other hotels
45min wait at bell desk
House keeping never serviced our room and it was disgusting, they didn't change the room and made us wait outside for 2hours before housekeeping even showed up.
The exit that says Uber Rideshare is controlled by the hotel-taxi mafia and make you walk a mile outside of the Luxor premises if you want to catch an Uber"
We don’t ask for much. We used the phone app to check in and that was very convenient. We had trouble with the prepaid self parking and ended up double paying. We didn’t interact with many employees other than restaurant workers. Was a little surprised at how expensive food and drinks are. Loved Blue Man Group.
"I never leave reviews but… even as a 25 year old who doesn’t need much and likes to party, this was trashy. Small, rundown old rooms. No different from like an old Holiday Inn (and we stayed in the tower which was supposed to be nicer). Always HOT in common areas. Always smell of weed in common areas and halls. Guests are rowdy 24/7. Some are even aggressive. It is loud everywhere. Few desirable food options. Wifi sucks. Elevator buttons rarely work correctly. It is not located close to fun things on the strip like shopping at Caesar’s Palace or Aria and Bellagio. No convenience store near."
Had not been to Vegas in 16 years. The Luxor was a great hotel and casino with friendly staff and clean room. The connecting hotels with access to additional stores and restaurants was a plus.  Would definitely stay again.
"The Luxor Hotel is worth the stay simply for the first reason, there is so much beautiful Egyptian decor all around.  Exploring the Luxor is exciting.  Lots of shops and places to eat. I would recommend the king size pyramid room so you can have a comfortable bed with a gorgeous view.  The customer service is excellent.  The roll out beds feel as comfortable as the king size bed.  The buffet was filled with variety and yummy food."
"I really enjoyed the fact that the hotel had so many amenities. The house keepers did a great job of checking the room each day. I had no issues with staff, but I felt like I didn’t deal with staff that much. It was like no one approached us for anything. Overall my experience was great and I would come back in the future."
Our room was in a location that was very loud. Our shower was clogged and flooding everywhere. When I called to ask for help the phone was so static that I couldn’t hear. They did not come up to fix my problem. Staying somewhere else next time!
"I am a Travel Agent so I was really looking forward to our stay and finding a good hotel to recommend to my customers, but I'm not sure if I would recommend to everyone. We had a stroller & the elevators were down so it was a nightmare.  We had to have security escort us everytime we needed to get to the 4th floor or the Mandalay Bay. If you don't have a stroller or wheelchair, then it shouldn't be a problem. The room was ok,  but I was disappointed our sink didn't drain properly when we arrived and there wasn't a coffee pot, microwave, or refrigerator.  I need a fridge for bottles,  but I didn't want to pay extra so we had to use the ice bucket. On a positive note, the bed were comfortable & there was a lot to do in the hotel.  I especially enjoyed the King Tut Exhibit."
"Disturbing, uncleaned rooms. Will never visit Luxor again. My expectations were different than what I expected. The rooms were so dirty that I wasn't even comfortable taking a shower. In the sink there was nasal discharge. You could see hairs everywhere"
Was told by the receptionist(who happened to be the manager)she was going to upgrade my room and take off resort fees and still ended up paying more just for a dirty room. This place was a absolute joke
Nice rooms and clean rooms. Lots to do at hotel they had exhibits and many shoes available. The look of the hotel is very unique and stylish. Really liked the tram system as well and the hotel had a good location.
Dirty rooms.  So loud you can't sleep.  Ridiculously expensive.   Better off sleeping in your car.  Worst trip I have ever experienced in Vegas.  Couldn't be worse if they were trying to suck.  I will never stay here again.
"Mold smell in the bathroom and room I stayed in. The view was horrible. I am allergic to mold. Lots of construction at the site. The line, every single day, to check in was ridiculously long. They would have 1 teller there for 100 person line. Just stupid."
Room was disgusting and uncomfortable. It was unsanitary and horrible for my family and I. They didn’t care when we told them there was mold and blood in the bathroom. The sheets were dirty and pillows smelled bad.
Room was unclean on check-in. Spotty make up service. Tub was full of dirty water when we checked in with used soap on ledge. Missed making up room one day. Last day housekeeping left trash and a used glove on my nightstand.
"We had a blast at Luxor! The hotel staff was super helpful and welcoming. The room was amazing, which made my wife and daughter very happy, which made for a happy and pleasant trip. The front desk personnel went out of their way to make sure the experience was pleasant and the check-in quick and easy. The cleanliness was impeccable and the view great! We are sure to come back, for a longer stay! Thanks!"
The electronic checkin is awesome. It’s like you’re home. No real need to interact with any of the staff.  The one thing I don’t like. The fact the buffet closes at 3 pm. By time you check in there’s no buffet open. Then you are forced into the food courts of the casinos. The restaurants in the area are ok. However plan ahead. You’re gonna need a reservation.
"The place is falling apart. The building is old and low quality. Walls are paper thing, you can't rest due to noise. 
They charge the hotel guests 18$ for parking which was full. I had to loiter around for 45 minutes to find a spot"
"Went between Christmas and new years. Had a nice stay, very clean room. Wish the room had a fridge. Tram at Hotel is very useful to save yourself steps. Great shows at this hotel. Elevator ride is interesting experience."
"Nice property near the strip at an affordable price. Rooms are not the fanciest, but are clean. Rooms expectingly lack fridge or microwave. Plenty options on site or nearby. Would stay again, but maybe not as long of a stay (5nights)"
"My room was clean and relaxing, I had the best sleep every night with a comfy bed and fluffy pillows. 
The hotel is clean and easy to get around.
The Backstage Deli has great sandwiches. 
The machines are plenty and the variety made it interesting."
"I’m a frequent traveler and I have never been cursed out by housekeeping for wanting clean washcloths and towels in my room. On a recent visit to Luxor in Las Vegas after passing housekeeping in hallway we informed staff that we were leaving, upon our return approximately 9pm our room was not serviced as we requested. Housekeeping cursed at my husband after he called and complained. He then notified front desk and complained. We have stayed at Luxor many times in the past and it was my husband’s favorite hotel in Las Vegas. Other than that incident the rest of the hotel staff was friendly."
After it took 1.5 hours to check in the staff gave us the wrong room. After standing in line for another 15 min they gave us the right room. However once inside we turned on the AC and it was terribly noisy. We were so tired of that we just had to endure the loud noise and tried to sleep as much as possible.
They added a $35.00 fee per night. Not disclosed until check-in. How is this legal? The food was okay. Blueman show was good. A nice walk to other hotels and shopping. You do not have to leave the hotel.
"Everything was great! No issues and staff was nice. I will probably stay here again in the future. I didn’t get my room cleaned every day, but when I needed some toilet paper, I received it quickly after requesting it."
"When you get to your room and see their is no menu, and call down you are informed that since covid Luxor does not do any room service. Someone tell me please what does room service have to do with covid since all the hotel opened by last april????? plus he fac they tell you can order food from one of the rest. and pic up...  bull....  90 percent are closed by 7 pm including what should be their 24 hour coffee shop Pryamid..   The only food place i could find at the luxor to take out food was the public house and i don't really want to eat nochos and cheese an hamburgers before bed.   shame on you mgm family...   your other hotels seem to room service and other options...   i am sending out an email to my whole company about this.....   also putting it all over social media"
It's an iconic hotel and overall experience was fabulous.  Easy to walk around the strip and enjoy the sites. Parking onsite needs some improvement during busy times and would have loved to know in advance of promos and discounts available - should have done more research in advance!  But family loved the hotel and experience.
"it was kind of a quick decision, last minute. My son and I decided check a show in Vegas and we landed on the Blue Man Group. Last time I saw that show was at lease 18 years ago. Still tons of fun as I remember, and from there on it was a very pleasant stay."
"Room wasn’t more than a mattress/box spring on the floor, with no closet, not even a bottle of water on arrival.  Bathroom had visible mold in shower, smoke odors throughout the entire casino.   By far the worst of any casino we have experienced in Vegas, nothing else close….CES convention had the casino hotels booked full so we couldn’t even switch to a cleaner place, never again will we even walk in the door"
"Had a blast and the hotel was very conveniently located near everything we wanted to do. Great restaurants, very clean, friendly staff 

I have to type 200 characters but I'm not going to gush about the place. It was good I'd give it a minimum of 9/10 on some days and a 10/10 on best days."
Very nice location. Was able to walk to a lot of the other casinos. Nice soaking tub.  Nice sofa area.  The Pyramid Cafe had a great breakfast. Need a coffee maker in the rooms. The bed was real lumpy. Needs new mattress.
I had the greatest time here at the Luxor I spent more of my time in the Luxor I still need to see mor so I will definitely be back as soon as I can staff were very helpful with any issues that I had food was great
"I talked to the front desk to a lady called Karen, terrible service…. 2 hr to send someone to fix the TV in my room, Its now 9pm, so I wont wait until, 11pm, I asked to change my room and she didn't wanted, also wanted t9 talk to a manager and she asked me to come physically to the front desk because managers dont talk to guests in their rooms…. Can you believe it?"
"I’ve stayed at the Luxor many times and it’s ok, it’s convenient if you’re going to allegiant stadium, but most of the elevators really need to be updated, you feel like you might not make it up to your room if you’re on a higher floor because they shake so much. Also would be really nice if the rooms had at least a coffee maker in them since they no longer offer microwaves and you have to special request a refrigerator, I feel like there’s no real amenities at this hotel. The food court I think can also use some updating in the vendors, or at least add some more."
"Very good hotel experience.  All aspects were at expectations or above.  The only drawback: paying for parking as a hotel guest. 18 dollars a day. Probably the norm, but still, I do not like paying for parking when I am staying at the said facility...."
"I was offered a room upgrade for an extra $35 night to their “newly” renovated room in the west towers. Room was spacious, but the room was maybe renovated 5+ years ago. Tables were run down, furniture had stains, faucets were filthy, bathroom needed a deep clean and mop, toilet wasn’t even flushed prior to us checking in."
Would not recommend. Check in process took over an hour. Luggage was lost by the bell hop. Never staying here again! Staff was also not friendly and lacking an understanding of caring for the customers. Choose any other property!
I was very upset with the way my trim  was handled. I have never stayed in a hotel that was musty and dirty.  A better cleaning staff is needed and management. I called the service desk and housekeeping several times and nothing was done. They sprayed something in the carpet. Didn’t work smell was still there.
The pharaoh cafe was subpar. My wife’s sand which was good but they did forgot to add the avacado mayo which the sand which was built around. I had the pharaohs pheast and the whole thing except the hash browns either tasted like nothing or was disgusting. I was in the middle of writing a review but my wife stopped me and said you all were just having a bad morning. So I let it be. The room was good and you even had the congratulations To the newly weds was a nice touch. But the AC was either bad or just poor quality as if you walked around or turned on the shower for a few minutes the whole room heated up and then you were sweating for an hour as it cooled down. Could be poor air circulation as well. When you drained the bath it would occasionally cause some gurgling noise the. The bathroom would smell gross to say the least. Which is quite unfortunate as when I stayed 3-4 years ago I had a great time which is why I booked it for my honeymoon. Odds are I won’t stay at Luxor again unless something changes.
"First time in vegas, we expected allot of fun but not this much fun! Staying at luxor was a Great idea! Allot to do and everyone was so freindly. I will be booking luxor and cant wait to expirence this again!"
We liked staying here as the price for location is perfect. I did not like the elevator as we had issues with it stopping on the 8th floor and had to have assistance with it. Other than that we enjoyed our stay.
"I would not stay here again. The hotel is old and not clean. I paid almost the same price here per night as Pallazo. We stayed with our kids at Pallazo  for three nights in the beginning of our trip and they loved it. Service, staff, cleanliness and food were awesome. I just booked one night at Luxor because my husband wanted to stay at this hotel. Never again. We were checked into a completely dirty room and even the 2nd room was not clean. Food was not good. If I could I would have checked out right away but we were forced to spend the night as the room charges for last minute booking in other preferred hotels was over $400/ night."
"Had to wait for a room well after the 3pm check in time, the room smelled awful, there was a yappy dog that woke us up at 7am each morning-even after complaining to security, the television channels didn't work. The buffet is not very good, definitely not worth $35 for breakfast. The crepe station is gone as well. The room was fairly inexpensive though, which is a plus. Parking is free if you are pearl level for MGM rewards."
"This has been by far the WORST hotel experience I have had and I have already started telling friends and family to avoid this hotel and casino. Not only did we have to wait 45 minutes to just check in but when we got to our room the bathroom was filthy outdated and the beds sank right in the middle. I couldn’t even use the room phone to call them because it was broken.. We decided to go downstairs and ask for another room but when they gave us the new room number the elevators for that section of floors was broken so we couldn’t get to our new room. We had to go back to the desk in line and ask for a THIRD room. We finally make it into our new room only to realize we had no cell connection. I couldn’t call my family or friends during our whole trip and instead had to FaceTime using wifi to reach them. Lastly, while I was working in the hotel room the alarm system went off for 30 minutes. I was in a meeting presenting and had to end it early because the speakers were so loud. Everyday there was something new and disappointing about this place. They truly made our stay extremely difficult."
Check-in takes forever. Manager completely unhelpful. The room reeked of cigarettes and looked like it had endured one party too many.  No toilet paper in the bathroom.  Public House has possibly the worst food in Vegas.
"It wasn't the worst.  The room was very dusty which means the cleaning is very superficial.  When I say dusty I mean visible chunks all along the head boards and lamps, etc.  Not fridge or coffee maker in room. This was a room block for a stay and play youth hockey tournament - not a good fit.  The casino floor was heavily smokey and perfumed more so than the other casinos we went into."
"Checked in on the 30th, dropped bags off in the room, arrived back at 3:00 am to discover filthy/dirty bed linen with hairs, lipstick and stains. The manager offered to compensate $100 for food; food, I want clean bed linens. Was brought a bag of linens at 4:00 am, that was also soiled. There is so much more I could say but I’m still furious how this played out. I got no rest and my trip was ruined. Lastly I would say, this is not an experience I expected especially since I paid nearly $400 a night, I’m writing their corporate office because I want to be compensated for my stay."
Wonderful experience and friendly staff! I highly recommend staying at this location. I plan on coming back again. The room was clean and we had a wonderful view. It's a short walk to all of the other casinos.
"We had a great experience on this holidays , we accommodate at the Luxor Hotel and the room was nice, clean and confortable . I always look the Luxor because is the best option when you make your numbers."
This stay was a very comfortable relaxing stay….Very clean well kept —very well located and friendly professional staff Rooms clean well maintained. The food court was well maintained and provided great surface
"well, let’s start with the room, they are old and not very clean. With all the money they make at the casino, you would think that they would invested into some nicer rooms. I actually saw a dog crap on the floor at least twice during my stay. The parking was a nightmare. I do not recommend this place whatsoever. I will never stay there again."
"We usually stay at Luxor, they give us the maximum of resort credit and free play. We love to walk the strip and travel in between resorts and find that the Luxor is perfectly located for our preference."
"Outdated, really basic . Motel feel at premium prices. Nothing special beyond the lobby and the elevators definitely need some maintenance. Stayed in a premium pryamid room but wasn't as luxurious as we were expecting. Also traveling with a dog, very pricey $50 extra per night and not very convenient long walk to go outside for the dog ."
The shower was covered in someone elses pubic hair when I arrived. The room was not cleaned and when I called they promised to send someone in to reclean and they didn’t. I hope I can sway someone from booking this hotel. Hallways are dirty and smelly. Stuff is rude and elevators barely work; you literally wait for 20 by the elevators to get anywhere. Horrible
"Room was pretty good... Air conditioner was the only real issue. Kept turning off on it's on. But looked like it had a motion detector so we never said anything. But last day it said off but was running.
All of the staff we dealt with were great. 
Casino was not the best but not the worst"
"Worst experience I have had in Vegas, our room smelled of cigarettes, bathroom had the smell of backed up sewage and the carpet in the hallway just outside of the room was soaking wet. I first found this out when I almost fell onto the ground because the tile was soaked from the carpet. I called and they did nothing, second time coming up girlfriend almost took a header. Once again called, and they said they would try to fix it and if it wasn’t done right away “we would have to just deal with it,” seriously what kind of customer service is that."
Cleaning staff were friendly and helpful! Always gave fresh towels and cleaned up beautifully. Have and would stay here again. Wish Luxor hosted a cirque de soleil show- that would be awesome and would bring me to Vegas more.
"Nice stay!

Super friendly hotel staff!

Guest parking could be better... 
Need clearer direction (go up the ramp!)  Parking at the Luxor is limited and the attendants aren't overly helpful.

I stayed in a room that has not yet been renovated and it was still just fine.. very clean and well maintained.... so don't let the elevators scare you! The elevators are a little rough.. not clean throughout my stay they have some graffiti like markings that feel a little poor.

Still nice and a good price give it a try!"
"We go to Vegas twice a year. Sue Laforce took great care of us and had everything set up for us. Sue Laforce is a great asset to Luxor. I am all about customer service, and she goes far and beyond to take care of us."
"Online check-in wasn't the best experience through the mobile application if you have more than one room.  It only checks you in for one room and you'll have to go through the check-in line at the hotel lobby for the second one. And there is no explanation about it through the mobile application upon check-in as well.  One  lady attempted to assist me with the check-in at the hotel lobby.  Except her, the rest of them didn't appear to be very friendly.  The room was nice and spacious (Premium Tower Room) but there were noises(loud music and noises) coming from outside throughout the night.  The wall is thin and the room next to our left has the water running and other noises (seems to come from the bathroom) through the wee hours and at dawn.  Noises can be heard from the hallway outside of our room as well."
Easy room and parking access. Clean Casino with a variety of games. Only recommendation would be a better ventilation air conditioning system for there was a smell of smoke in the air from people smoking and a bit stuffy.
"Smelly, musty room, elevator not working, no staff in sight to give us guidance on the best alternative way to reach our floor (15th floor), security fee was not refunded altho the check in clerk informed us that it will be"
"The mattress was very squeaky and lumpy. The sheets were dirty and there’s no coffee pot or microwave. Not good for a flight attendant, when we have to carry food with us on overnight trips with no fridge to put it in. The staff was very friendly with great personalities"
"Great time! We could walk, and see so many things from the location. My daughter loved every bit of the little vacation. Come during a raiders game was busy but the staff was so helpful!! Thanks for everything you guys do!"
I've come out to Vegas a few time now. I asked my kids where they would like to go for Christmas. They said they want to see what I've been talking about that I saw. We spent 5 nights at the Luxor. They saved me some money when we checked in & checked out. Everyone was completely friendly & helpful.
The resort atmosphere is great but expect to spend a lot of money. Everything is overpriced and none of the hotel apps work. Don't expect to win any money playing casino games. They are more for the experience but no one wins JACKPOTS or real money.
"The hotel needs updating. I'm disappointed that they haven't banned smoking in this hotel/casino, it smells like a trashy strip club everywhere inside. The walkways are a death trap. Elevator = washer machine."
"there old dog poop in our room under the chair. DISGUSTING, just shows how they dont clean their rooms or dont clean areas of the rooms. Also weird intermittent drilling sounds during the night. gross"
"We were checked into a room that had no working A/C - and this was known at the time we were checked in.  Spent 2 nights in a hot room.  Maintenance was called but could do nothing.  We ended up moving to a new room after 2nd night to get working A/C.  At check-out, I asked if there could be some kind of comp for the inconvenience.  Clerk told me that he would remove the first two nights from our bill.  Now at home reconciling my credit card charges and I see that I did NOT receive the comp promised to me.  This hotel has fallen way off from what it used to be and I would not recommend Luxor to anyone I know."
"Room location bad, cleanliness subpar, parking issues, slow service at registration. Put on a floor that was supposed to be closed for maintenance work, had to move all our luggage to another area. Very inconvenient and had no help."
Loved my stay. This is the second time and I’ll definitely be staying here in the future. The spa services are awesome. See Sharronda H. for your waxing and other skin care services. See Diane for your nails.
"Interesting from the outside, yes.  But that’s it.  The entire hotel and casino is old, outdated, filthy and in dire need of update & repair.  The worst rooms we have ever stayed in on the strip. Amenities are nowhere to be found. Elevators & escalators not working properly, if at all.  Staff didn’t clean or restock either of our rooms on Sunday.  That hotel hasn’t seen a deep cleaning since the original pyramids were built.  We will return to Vegas, but never to the Luxor again.  It was terrible."
Room key did not properly function on the first day. Front desk didn't resolve the problem. Unable to get room service due to restaurant o line set up. Wasn't aware there was no coffee maker or iron..
The room could have been cleaner I only spent a few hours in the room since I was there for 1 night for a meeting but while I was there I noticed it was hair on the shower floor and walls and the room smelled like cigarettes
"overall a great value casino, great rooms!  clean.  black jack games are not good, poor rules, better off not playing them.  parking is expensive.  decent area on the strip, easy to get in and out of the parking structure"
The Luxor Hotel and Casino is a great place to stay in Vegas if you are looking for somewhere that’s not going to be too busy. It’s at the south end of the strip away from the most popular places to stay (bellagio and Caesars) so it sees a bit less tourist traffic than others which I enjoy. Table games are always a reasonable price. They also have good restaurants in the hotel.
"The MGM app and digital check in DON""T WORK - DON""T use  MUST go to the front desk and get a KEY!!  Digital Key would  not even allow use of  the elevator and when i went to my floor with all my bags - ""digital"" key would  not open my door - when I called front desk to complain - they ""SHAMED ME"" for NOT going to  the desk and getting a plastic KEY - even though the APP is proud of the fact your are supposed to be able to ""SKIP THE FRONT DESK"" total BS - reported maintenance  problem in room and they didn't show up till after 1 AM and called us on the phone at that time waking us UP!  more BS - also there is exactly ONE elevator location for any floor and the WALK to your room from there can be a MILE -"
Easy access to park and get into casino quickly. It’s on the strip with tram access to other casino resorts. Not expensive but the room was very nice and good bed. Plenty of places to choose to eat at from food court. Great stay for the value
"Spend a little more and save yourself a headache. Rooms were dirty and not vacuumed,  toilet had pee in it, shower door was broken, lumpy mattress,  half the escalators and walkways were out of service. Just overall rundown hotel."
I had stopped on a road trip with my brother for a night on the way to see family for Christmas. When we arrived and checked in we noticed the room smelled like cigarettes. We had been driving for 9 hours and just wanted to get some rest so we decided to not go back down and complain and went to bed. We checked out early in the morning and left. The next day I noticed a $250 charge to my card. I called and asked about it and they told me it was a standard hold and that it will be released back. The day after Christmas the charge went through. I called and they informed me that I was being charged a smoking fee. I told them that neither of us smoked and we noticed the smell as soon as we walked in the door. She put me on hold and came back saying that she was going to refund me. I hang up check my bank to see that she instead of refunding me $210 she accidentally charged me an additional $210. Just the worst possible timing for someone to be taking money non stop from me.
"The whole property was smelling like smoking weed and Cigaret. Even though you walk through the property, it was smelling lime rotten things and carpet was nasty. I would not go in luxor again. I ll try another property"
I would recommend it to my friends and family . Everything was good except the music it was too loud the first day .the casi was really good but in a busy day the waitress take longer to take your order and take your drink .
"Easy check-in, large rooms, good meal options are finally back after the pandemic. Still my go--to place to stay after all these years.  Prefer the tower rooms over the pyramid rooms.  Pre-paid parking got screwed up last time because I checked in on the app.  No problems this time because I checked in at the desk."
"Recently, while staying at the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas had a couple of things happen that was not happy about firstly, every morning when I walked out of my room, which was on the 19th floor in the pyramid, I stepped in a huge puddle of water, so obviously there was leaking plumbing, which they did nothing about Secondly, not once, but twice housekeeping walked in on me, and my wife, while one of us was sitting on the bathroom, toilet, highly embarrassing. Lastly, while eating at the Buffay, there was a gentleman walking around with a dog sitting on the shoulder around and over the food which I find highly disgusting , and that alone completely ruined my trip."
"I been there last weekend between. Thursday to Saturday and let me tell you about this experience. I got a pyramid room which was nice besides the fact toilets not functioning properly. But wish that was the main problem on the day of arrival I went at night get me something to eat and a prostitution was the n the hallway asking me if she can join to my room it feels like no security at all near elevators and anyone can get access to guest rooms 
I spoke with one of the managers Alfonso from retail who was decent enough offer me my resorts fee back and get me a 25$ voucher for meal 
The thing that pissed me off is the reception manager I think her name was Ashley says they don’t have control around elevators then what do I pay resort fee for? Is it so hard put a security around elevators like almost all mgm properties does?
Usually I stay at the aria and went there just because luck if choice 
3 starts are only because Alfonso"
Reserved a tower suite and got a pyramid suite with bugs and leaky toilet. Very disappointed. Staff was great but pyramid suite room was very far from elevator. Leaky toilet made me not not want to user the toilet
Got married here 10 yrs ago. This place has taken a dive . It has gone backwards not forwards. Beat western is a much better stay then this place. Split horribly!  Bed was really worn out! I do not recommend this place anymore. I was super dissatisfied
"My main gripe: These hotels being in millions upon millions of dollars in revenue, yet can’t be bothered to fix a damn thing. The amount of times we encountered a broken elevator or escalator was insane. Two out of 4 elevators in the elevator area nearest our room were broken all weekend we were there, so getting back up to our room at the end of the night was a 20 minute crowded ordeal.  Too greedy to pay the overtime for union workers?  Never once saw a broken slot machine though lol.  Good notes: The room was fine (aside from the 1970’s quality tv programming), and the shower was great."
"Great value hotel with good service. Though does not have a mini fridge or a bathtub, was overall quite satisfied with the experience.

One thing to note is that it would take about 20mins to walk to the Planet Hollywood area!"
"I stayed here with my son for one night because I thought it would be a fun novelty. I just didn’t realize how dated the rooms were (no USB and no smart technology at all) until we checked in. Felt more like a motel and less like the other MGM hotels. Again, not the worst experience but I just prefer other locations more. I did find all of the staff experiences of the hotel, restaurants, casino, etc to be really helpful and have no other complaints."
You get what you pay for. I should have known better. Staff was nice except one really rude female bartender. Room heat didn’t work and. worst of all ceiling leaked water got all in my bed. Next time I’ll pay the extra and stay at a premium property
"Mediocre place - you get what you pay for! We only stayed there because of kids dance competitions, not staying anymore. One of our colleagues got robbed also. No options for quality coffee- only Starbucks, yikes!"
"Business is very good location to stay. No one bother u and u get everything easy and fast . I strongly recommend this hotel for future stays. Food is good , friendly staffs and most important is that u can access to everything very easy"
"Came to town for our son's destination wedding and to look for a new home. We believe it's still one of the best values in town. Room was spacious, even though a few updates would be welcome. Staff was helpful and friendly. Housekeeping staff was always on top of any time of day. There's enough variety in the resort's restaurants to fit your budget and your palette and it was within a short trip to everything we needed, via the Tram or Lyft. We had a great stay at a reasonable rate for our extended stay."
There was a loud fan outside the adjacent room’s door with its electrical cord running across our door. The fan was loud and ran all night. We had to stop over the cord in order to get into our room. We couldn’t believe they would put us in this room!
"Very slow checkout, extremely long walk to room, poor facilities maintenance, broken shower door, insufficient toilet paper & kleenex tissue,  dirty carpets, stains all over, being charged resort fee & resort not being available, pure ripoff"
"Enjoyed my stay very much. Beautiful hotel, amazing pool, places to eat, good location, friendly staff. Good price. Would love to come back if that is something will bring me back in the future. Thank you"
The ground floor is excellent but everything else is horrible. My room had mold and leaked. The place still have popcorn ceilings. The rooms look just like the pictures just 30 years ago.my lampshade even had stains.
"This was my first time stayed at Luxor due to the competition was hosted at the hotel. However, I will never go back to this hotel again. 

First, I called them the night before I checked in to the hotel to make sure I got the connecting room for me, my partner and my two kids, and they confirmed yes, but when I arrived at the hotel, they were actually adjoint rooms not connecting rooms at all. I called and talked to them in person, but none of them were very helpful. So we ended up to stay in two separated rooms with walking back & forth all the time during our stay.

The hotel room looks outdated. The toilet was super hard to flush, and the shower door was rusted. Even thought the West Tower we stayed at supposed to be remodeled.

The air in the hotel was really bad and smoky which caused all four of us sore throats and bad allergies.

The restaurants there were very pathetic compared to other hotels.

Overall, I was very happy when we finally checked out from Luxor. It’s definitely not a family friendly hotel, and I will never stay there ever again."
Great price and location and rooms were quiet. Checking was quick and easy and a lady helped right when I got there to get me checked in so I didn’t have to wait in line and was able to do it all from my phone
"Our shower ceilings were bubbling from water damage and had a lot of black mold. The hotel didn’t seem to care. Contacted via social media and email, received aloof generic responses. The front desk didn’t seem to care either"
Room was late. Terrible for a suite. The whole location is dated. Everything is old and beat. Eating options are kind of weak. I will say that they did adjust some things for the inconveniences but it's a day late and a dollar short because the dollar value doesn't match the impact of the inconveniences.
"Iconic hotel. Nice people. Fun decor & holiday decorations.
Access to everything & a small casino. I could find my people easy! We will be back again when our next kid turns 21! Love the Blueman group."
"When we arrived we were told our reserved rooms were not available. The substitute rooms also had issues. Room was not as clean as it should have been. Toilet, shower, and sink issues. Luckily the staff was understanding and willing to help the best they could."
"The offer from MGM to stay at the Luxor hotel for 4 days. I was comped the 4 days plus $100 food and $40 free play, for the action that I'd given the Excalibur hotel 3 years ago. When I made the reservation, the person who took it took their time to help me book the room, and then gave me a couple of suggestions for shows. My room is first class, looks brand new with a 50 in TV set. The shower and the bathroom was excellent, with plenty of towels and a great shower. Haven't tried the buffet but there's plenty of food choices in the casino. I do believe the slots are a lot looser here than the rest of the strip. Checking was fast and friendly, no line with plenty of help getting my bearings. If you're on a budget, try this place,."
"Stayed at Luxor for a dance competition.  Check in was challenging.  Even though I had checked in on line several hours before I arrived, my room was not ready at 4:15 so I had to check in at the counter.  Room did not have coffee maker.  Did not like having to go downstairs for coffee each morning. Comfortable beds and room was quiet"
"Had issues with the elevators not functioning and leaving mass amounts of people waiting for 2 elevators. Waited a good 25-30 during peak times to get an elevator with any open space. Online check in did not work at all, so we had to wait about 25 in line to get our room. We had early check in and it took a little while to get our room sorted."
"I booked this hotel for a 16 hour layover! Paid the $20 for the early upgrade and my room was ready at 10:30 AM, so that was awesome and very pleased with that! The bellhop who held and brought our luggage to our room was very pleasant and very friendly - tipped him and you’d think he won the lottery! Such a nice guy! My star rating comes from the out dates rooms and the hard as rock beds! Even the TV is old and fuzzy, no mini fridge, etc. this was perfect for a long layover option so you’re not in the airport all day and don’t have to take your luggage with you but I certainly would not book the room for a longer stay! The decor and theme of the hotel is really neat though and we enjoyed looking at it!"
If they offer a $50 voucher you make sure you find out exactly where it can be used because apparently it can’t be used everywhere in the hotel. When I checked in at 9pm at night the person working said my room wasn’t ready when I was suppose to check in at 3pm.. Bought a king size room & they gave me 2 queen size bed room. Check out time is at 11am. I asked to check out at 12pm. $10 charge.. Never had that happen before. $20 a day to park for ALL GUEST. That’s insane you charge for parking for your guest. When you want to contact the front desk just expect to be on hold for at least 10 minutes. I could more than once & both times I stayed on the line for 10 plus minutes waiting to talk to someone. Overall I’ve stayed at numerous hotels on the strip & this is the first time I got charged for all this. My first & last time I will be staying here
"I am not a fan of the mega resorts anymore, but the room, and the housekeeping staff were quite nice.  Not a fan of all the fees… Resort, parking, etc.… And traffic has gotten horrendous on the strip. I don’t care for how”big” the city has gotten."
"Everything was convineint to find, ice and vending machine were right down the hall. Food court was good. You can find your way to the strip by going through the excalibur. Friendly staff. Overall i would say my family had a great stay."
"Rooms are clean, beds are big, great location & everything was perfect as always! Check-in was so easy and the MGM rewards are very useful. Downloading the app is a huge benefit, the access to everything is right at your fingertips with no need for face to face interaction with front desk. I love it!! Hands down my fav hotel on the strip."
"Stayed there because of the ease of walking to Allegiant Stadium (reason for our trip).  But also great location for Cirque shows at Bellagio and MGM Grand.  Ari in bar and Yvonne at check in so helpful and friendly.  Probably not going to happen anytime soon, but the suite tower rooms could use an overhaul.  Yes, they are spacious, and even though people ask, ""How much time do you really spend in your room?"", the answer is enough, and it should be clean, well appointed and comfortable. Bed and pillows a tad lumpy, and could use more bathroom towels.  Also, ALL the furniture in this hotel is low to the ground! Many joke about how it is designed that way to keep people in their seats, and that may be true, but BAD experience!  even in the suite--almost fall into the chair/couch. Not so sweet if injured!!"
"We got a room early morning saturday to get away from fremont and the homeless overrunning their casino and the streets.  Luxor had our room ready by 9am, getting us out of a horrible experience.  The luxor is a great place to hang out.  We did the bodies exhibit which was super cool.  Thank you luxor for saving our vegas weekend."
"Check in was easy, upgrades were reasonably priced. Every staff member was nice and welcoming. Tender Steak was great. Carrot Top was surprisingly hilarious. The casino floor was big enough for me, the lack of Konami slot machines was my only complaint. Diablo Cantina kind of sucks like I expected, the drinks tasted cheap and over sweetened. Public house was solid for food and drinks, and their Oreo milkshake was awesome. Sports book was kind of small and old but it works. The elevators suck. The spa was nice, my massage was good, don’t book too close to closing time or you will feel rushed after instead of being able to chill and use everything in the spa. The location is perfect for going to Raiders games and not too bad even if you wanted to walk to Mandalay, MgM or Cosmo. I’d recommend this to anyone optimistic and go with the flow. Quick to judge negative Nancy’s can go ahead and pay more to stay elsewhere and I bet you’ll still have more fun here."
I ordered a very expensive meal that I could not finish I brought it to my room and there was no refrigerator nor microwave so I wasted a $168.. There is no  Shuttle to or from the airport.  No one took the time to explain anything about the MGM rewards.
good price best location good service rooms are great and clean beautiful hotel and casino very exotic construction nice and impressive egyptian theme Being able to transport yourself from one casino to another by train is excellent I will definitely come back.
Outdated technology. Poor signage. The elevator was a nightmare for so many guests. The code on cell phone  didn’t work to operate the elevator. Parking was charged to my room but I didn’t receive a code. I had to pay again to get out of the garage. No maid service unless you stay more than 3 days. Slots very tight. Did not gamble there. Overall unsatisfied. Staff was friendly.
Close to airport and very affordable rooms so didn’t need to rent a car while we visited . I would stay again at this hotel and would recommend to a friend . Good water pressure in the shower and for the most part the room didn’t smell like smoke.
Great stay always a good time here. The room was cleaned well. The smell of cigarettes wasn’t bad as it is downtown old town. The staff is friendly. Prices are worth the stay. Awesome location to all events.
"Nice property near the strip at an affordable price. Rooms are not the fanciest, but are clean. Rooms expectingly lack fridge or microwave. Plenty options on site or nearby. Would stay again, but maybe not as long of a stay (5nights)"
"Nice , clean, comfortable . I had Read articles about it being haunted but we Didn’t experience any hauntings. It was a VERY LARGE PLACE So be prepared to walk ! It took us a minute to figure out self parking ."
The hotel was very nice would stay there again. Only problem was the check in I mentioned in this survey.  Good prices inside the hotels could be cheaper. Food court seemed expensive. Besides that the visit was very nice.
"Very disappointed.  Room was clean but in serious need of upgrade.  First time I’ve seen a hotel room with no coffee pot, mini fridge or USB ports.  Rooms are tired & worn.  Very difficult experience from our stay at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club.  Would not stay here again.  All I kept thinking is that a cheap refresh would go a very long way here.  If all you care about is a place to sleep it’s fine…."
"Our suite was exceptionally dirty and outdated. Hair on towels, floor not vacuumed, could wipe visible dirt off the dresser. Had I been able to book a room somewhere else, I would have. During our stay there was a person having a seizure off to the side of the casino floor. Three security personnel were standing off to the side of the family were joking around and unprofessional. The next day when my husband was carrying our pillows out to our car parked in the garage, he was detained by security that pushed him against a car and his hands were held behind his back while he tried explaining he was a hotel guest, but he couldn't get our room key out of his pocket due to being detained. I called down to security, and they took my information but there was no follow through from Juan that said he would look into it.
We had stayed here earlier this year and had a good experience, so we were definitely disappointed in this trip."
"The Luxor is a dump, avoid at all costs, dingy, tired, dirty, depressing, should be bulldozed flat, even the employees dont want to be there. Everything just as expensive as other place on the strip, but far lower quality. Zero stars, had to put one to complete the review."
"todo accesible, buen servicio y sobre todo, un excelente ambiente para pasarla bien. Recomendado

everything accessible, good service and above all, an excellent environment to have a good time. recommended"
Bathroom sink was clogged upon our arrival. We called housekeeping twice to no avail. The next morning we were awaken by a call from the engineer. He called to say he was on his wY up to fix the sink. We declined. We were still in bed and we were due to check out that morning. So at that point there was no reason for the engineer to intrude.
"Great stay. Love the hotel. Love the casino. Too bad the price of parking is different in the app and when you actually check in. Its also not good the days we stay the buffet is close. And when we encounter problem with the hotel when water in the room stop. Nobody even comp’d us or tried to help. Which they will tell you not they’re fault which is understandable, but if it were them staying in the hotel and encounter the same thing they are the ones who wants compensation."
My family had a great stay at the Luxor. Checkin was easy to do from my phone no waiting in line. Our rooms were really nice and clean and comfortable beds. Easy access to the strip. Great experience at the restaurants and casino
Luxor was not willing to work with the airplane customers who were stuck no additional mon  or food. In my case no additional medicine as well as my husband’s. So very disappointing  not sure but I believe they would’ve left you out in the cold
"The 1st room we got does not have electricity from any wall outlet in the living room, neither of the TV, refrigerate, or lamp in the room works. No other room is available on that day. We have to move to another room after 1 day of stay. 

On the 2nd day no room service was done. Uncollected trash in the room but no clean towers. We called for room service and was told someone would bring towers and collect trash. But no one showed up. 

On the 3rd day, the little tool my son uses to take in and out his contact lenses was missing after the room service. We have to drive out trying to buy a new one. It was hard to find one after mid night. When we desperately returned to hotel around 2am, we were told to park at Mandalay Bay because Luxor's parking lot was full. We had to walk from Mandalay Bay parking to Luxor in the 2am coldness and did the reverse early next day morning to buy the tool my son needs. I feel my vacation was ruined."
"Dirtiest room I've seen in 22 yrs of travelling. Yellow stains on bed sheets, dirty carpets. Wobbly elevators. Everything is old, smelly and disgusting. We paid for the 'Stay Well' rate, which basically was a wall mounted humidifier with air freshener smell that tried to hide the stink in the room. We left in 5 minutes, asked for a refund, which they gave. Dragged our luggage to Mandalay Bay next door, which is much better.

Don't stay at Luxor. Many other options in Vegas."
"The rooms in the tower are always nice, comfortable bed!  The shower was plugged but they fixed it the day I mentioned the problem.  I love the views from the tower rooms as well.  Overall a great stay and will visit again."
"We have chosen Luxor for our last 3 stays in Vegas. The Hotel is truly unique, we like the expansive space in the middle, the Casino ceilings are high and feels very open. It is a square, so easy to navigate. We like the location with Mandalay Bay, Delano, wonderful restaurant and bar options, and tram to Excalibur and the Tropicana intersection. Mlife App makes the Check-in/out process seemless. Thank you!"
"The architecture of this hotel is amazing and stands out on the Las Vegas skyline but inside is a disaster from check in to check out.  I used their mobile app to check in but this didn’t work properly so I ended up waiting in their ridiculously long line.  A large number of people got in the elevator and nobody’s key would work so we were trapped until the elevator doors opened and we escaped.  The tv in our room didn’t work. We had the misfortune of having a room right above the East Tower entrance where they play “pleasant music” which we had to listen to all night.  The Luxor parking lot is horrible and isn’t large enough to meet the demand. We were charged for parking in this lot twice when we only stayed for one night with one car so we had to wait in that ridiculously long line again because the Luxor is not properly staffed.  We were told to use our room key to exit but, of course, none of the keys worked.  Need I go on? Many large Las Vegas hotels have problems like these but not to thus extent.  We will never stay at the Luxor again."
Nicely situational between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur with the MGM rewards means you can take advantage of three hotels without leaving the buildings. The Luxor's Egyptian theme is unique in Vegas and provides a fun yet cozy experience.
"Theft in room and no action what so ever so far. 
Room service was missed one day and there was no ""no disturb sign"". Casino floor was full of smoke which made us and kids uncomfortable even when crossing it."
The first room we got had a bad smell and because of that reason my brother got allergie. We called front desk and they were fast and friendly and gave us a different room made things way better and we had a good time
This place is worse than Motel 6.  They don’t provide a coffee maker. Who is ever heard of a hotel without a coffee maker in the room? The TV is horrible. I didn’t even have HBO. They did not have a microwave or a fridge raider.
"I stayed here a few times already and they treat you like they are doing you a favor, the rooms are not great and you pay a lot for a suite and if you want to stay more nights they make you go downstairs and do all the process of checking in again and they charge you way more, the receptionist or front desk do not treat you well they don’t care about your needs and basically ignore you, the machine stole money from us in the casino and nobody came to help us ever horrible experience and terrible customer service"
"Horrible customer service, had to switch rooms after the first night due to A/C not working. The staff did nothing to accommodate the A/C not working. Switched rooms on the next night only to have the water shutoff for an extended period of time. The rooms in the towers are very noisy, the doors to the rooms do not drowned the hallway chatter from other guests. There were also TV issues, most channels did not work what seemed to be due to not being able to connect to the cable tv or satellite provider.

STAY AWAY FROM THE LUXOR."
The check-in process take too long. I didn't understand why they made you pay for self parking when you're already paying to stay there also when I go out it was asking to pay for parking each time I don’t understand why room card is not programmed as per the stay.
"Kuddos all the staff, will be back soon! I thought I will be having a hard time. Especially the check in the line is super long, but staff are friendly, accommodating and fast checking out, WiFi is great’"
"This was a fantastic spot for a quick trip. Staff was friendly, and it was close to some awesome trips and exhibits. The titanic and king tut ones were especially cool. Easy walking distance to coke/m&m/Hershey's."
The majority of the dealers were rude and not friendly to play with. I never travel to Vegas planning on winning. I actually enjoy playing but not here. You would think when people are tipping you that you would be nicer. I will never stay there again. This is the first time I have had a problem with a MGM property.  This one missed the mark all the way!
Stayed here for the first time over Christmas 2022. Was pleasantly suprised with the size and layout of the dual queen room. Elevators or  lol inclinators ( they tilt up to 39 degrees) took some getting use to. Definitely worth the price. Good selection of food on site. I recomend  Diablos.
Bad from the start.  We had to circle the property twice just to find parking.  Long walk from parking with luggage and bags.  Once we’re inside Luxor we can smell the bad odor.  Many bad signs and we force ourselves to stay and we regret every second we were there.
"I've had better experiences at a Red Roof Inn. From the hours long check in / check out line and the downright rude front desk service, to the smelly dilapidated rooms and elevator death traps this visit was a massive disappointment. Glad we were able to have fun elsewhere, but would not come back to Luxor (or MGM)."
"My husband and I were checked in at Luxor from December 22 - 28, Room 10129. On our first day, I used the shower and I am so upset because of the tub is draining slow, when I checked the drain, it is clogged full of hair. The cabinet and drawers are dusty and sticky. I don’t have time to call the attention of the housekeeping because of our planned itinerary. Second day, I am expecting that there will be an improvement, unfortunately, it is still the same. I tried to call the housekeeping department but no answer. So it is Christmas day and I don’t think the cleaners know my complaints so I took my time to go see the front desk, the guy is very apologetic and in fact, he gave me new king suite room at the west tower which is not good, yes it is clean but it is too far from our previous room that could cause more inconvenience to us. I went back to the front desk and informed him that it will not work out for us, instead just inform the housekeeping about my concern. Plus, do you know that there are no slippers available in Luxor? I asked the lady at the front and she said it is unavailable, so strange right? Being very busy with thousands of guests everyday, they don’t have enough supply of slippers for their gusts on this holiday season. Guess what, we are in our fourth day and my issue wasn’t resolved at all. I checked the drain of the tub and it is still the same, plus, the trash bin in the toilet wasn’t change, how do I knew? My liner still sticks in the plastic. So gross and very unhygienic. My husband asked me not to stress about it because it will ruin our stay. To sum it up, I don’t think the room is really ready for us. I will not accept the reason that Luxor ia overwhelmed with the number of guests, Luxor should be ready in any ways.Don’t get me wrong, there was one and only part that I really appreciate them, mobile check out is the best. Thank you, Luxor! I hope you will improve your service."
"Fun trip, everything was expensive  casino was nice, could never get a drink while aging. Rooms outdated and you don't leave water in them. We have to go down and pay $ 5 for a bottle of water.  My husband had to pay $18 for a beer. Food wad expensive also."
Use my MyVEGAS points and did a one night stay. Front desk was very helpful and offered us an upgrade. The room was clean for the most part. Plumbing probably needs to be updated since it is an older building. The sinks took a while to drain. Our room had the large tub and that was nice! We had dinner at Diablo’s Cantina and that was really good! Check out was easy. I just used my app to check out. I would definitely recommend staying here!
"As a former Vegas resident, still enjoy the city but prices have been going tru the roof and service has been getting worse, if paying for the Vegas experience this wasn’t it!! Maybe in the future not to distant."
"Nancy by check in has a huge attitude, treated me and my wife like we didn't belong because we asked for help finding our room, she said she can't move from that spot and said she can explain, I said ma'am we can't find it, we looked, we asked multiple people and keep going in a circle, we are clearly missing something, we are on a schedule to get married we just need some help please. HER LITERAL NEXT STEP, said she's calling security. She asked for the room keys and looked surprised when I game them to her, then demanded ""give me your id sir"". Her tone was harsh and then security corrected her over the radio by saying ""why are you calling us, that's guest services""....then the manager comes and she walks us and I told her that we felt like we were treated very poorly by Nancy, like we were feeling like we were about to be kicked out for asking for help, she then gets defensive and says, "" she can't move from that spot so what do you want from her"" at that point I made the decision to never go to this resort again. I'm a store manager and would never allow a guest to tell me my employee made them feel uninvited and unwelcome on a honeymoon without addressing that feeling first and helping them recover, and mind you it was not a regular room and paid a lot more for what we got, the tub would back into the shower and took about a hour to go down, but Nancy really was way way way worse, it was the tone for me and my wife that really sucked."
My family’s Christmas vacation was a wonderful experience starting with our stay at the Luxor. We were 3 different families with 3 different stays all there. We all experienced a great time there. Will definitely do this again and at the Luxor. Thank you for everything!
"Super dirty rooms. The housekeeping is a joke. We had hair on towels, insects in the tub and constant knocking and noises from the room connected to us. The first room we checked in had a broken television so we were moved to a room on the lowest floor. The AC did not work in that room but we were too tired to keep complaining. They did not have comforters either. There were just two sheets on the bed. They gave us complimentary ticket to use for drinks and restaurants next day but all the options had bad reviews. We tried to go to one place - Diablo something but they said there is a 20 min wait despite there were literally four tables occupied. We gave our complimentary ticket back to the front desk."
Some of the rooms need to be upgraded. I hade broken bathroom tile and the caulk was peeling. The Buffet is closed on Tues and Weds and it  closes way too early. The Buffett hours are really short as well. The hours are only 8am-3pm
After having stayed at the luxor many times I will never stay there again from poor attitudes from staff to the ceiling falling in chunks on me in the shower and being treated like it was nothing the rooms and staff were the worst I've ever experienced never again.
We decided to go to Las Vegas for Christmas. We call the MGM rewards and they offer a very attractive rate. The bedroom was simple but clean and the staff very friendly. The location is Ok. Easy to get the tram to arrive at other hotels.
"Rooms are dated, was given accessible room. Bathroom flooded after shower. Bathroom latch was broken. Was allocated a room on the first floor which was hard to locate. Nobody in the luxor staff was able to navigate us properly"
"Besides the rooms, which were 1980s condition with tiny tv’s, the casino sucked.  Barely any tables open with auto shufflers except for 2 tables with a minimum bet of $500.   Food was terrible  and it cost me $25 for a Jonny Rockets double cheese burger"
"I've stayed at Luxor in the past.  The most memorable visit was back in 1997, and that was a far better experience than this time.  I missed the 'inclinators' which seem to have been replaced with regular elevators, and as I already mentioned, the lack of a mini bar fridge in the room was disappointing."
"Charged me an additional fee since I booked through Groupon. Did not disclose this at check in and when I finally found a number to call where I could get some customer service, they refused to credit me back in full. Said it was Groupon's responsibility to notify me...If Luxor is charging me, it's their staffs responsibility to notify me."
"Room very dusty, after wiping the room down our overall stay was amazing with family and friends, thank you to the Luxor staff, the wedding guests had a blast, see you all next year Happy Holidays from ou family to yours"
"I didn't appreciate waking up & having to go 4 floors down, on a walk across the huge casino, locate a coffee shop & spend a bunch more money just to get my morning coffee! I was shocked the rooms didn't offer complimentary coffee!!!"
"We were there for our 9th Anniversary. End up my husband lost his phone on one of the machine. Becase he walked to the cash machine just for 1 min and forgot to take the phone with him. When he returned it was gone. We asked for help but no one care. The security said nothing they could do about it. We filed the report but didn't help us anything. Also The odd of machine also very low. Put 100 in just to get just 10 dollars back in the bonus spins. I have tried many of them and they are the same,very tight. Food was very expensive around here. The buffet was not much in it for the price. We paid $62 for two but only eggs,salad and potato with a litle bit of fruits on the bar so it wasn't worth it. We woke up early every morning during our stayed because always some worker working on something like drilling at 7:15 am. Or cutting wood sounds in the morning was so disturb."
"Just average, bill was too much slot machines don’t pay. I spent $2000 and only won $500
Staff asking for tips “ we work based on tips”
Parking is expensive 
Room wasn’t great, felt old style 
Check in app was the only thing that I liked"
"Room:  no coffee pot, no microwave, no mini-fridge, no clock, no fitted sheets on bed, ugly outdated wallpaper and window coverings. Long check-in lines.  Hard to find anyone for any type of service.  Very disappointing,  Find another place to stay.  The nicest people were the housekeeping staff and they do a good job providing clean rooms,  That's it though."
"The Luxor offers the basic minimum for a classic Casino/Strip experience in Vegas at a great affordable price, at least compared to other hotels on the strip. The entertainment options were great and the rooms were excellent."
"Still one of the best properties in Vegas! From the staff, hotel cleanliness, food and bar selection...You name it! AND THE ROOMS ARE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE! Give Luxor a try, you'll love it and you'll definitely come back. Trust me!!!"
Valet experience was horrible. Machine always wanted to double charge. Room was filthy esp after we used our own clorax wipes. Tv never worked. Feont desk never cared at all. Check in was long but lady was nice
We appreciate the comps but just didn't feel a s special as we normally do when coming to the Luxor. The room was OK but very old and rundown. the slots seemed very tight. We really enjoyed the pyramid cafe and staff. the staff in the vip room were nice and got a dresser sent to our room as there was no place to store our clothes? We had to call everyday to get real coffee pods delivered. We never heard from our casino host while there so she must have been very busy.We will look into staying at a different property next time.
I had a long layover and this hotel had a great price short distance and Exelent service n bed was so comfy I sleep for 7 hrs n was back at the airport will come back soon for a longer stay. Defenelly recomendem
"So needed time off from family, work, and stress. Luxor was a nice less expensive option and the hotel rooms were worth it. I wish its location would be closer to the main entertainment on the strip. And the hotel bars would close later than 12:30 am."
"I would have given this property a negative 100 if possible. There is no way possible I should be out of town afraid to sleep because of roaches. All 3 rooms were very dirty. Carpet was dirty and worn, stains in the tub, hair in the walls of the shower… just nasty!"
"The room had no coffee maker, fridge, microwave. Not usual for a 4 star hotel/casino. Didn't honor comped room.  In need of upgrade. Casino was ok, security seemed ok but, when someone passed out blackjack table, it took a while for the medical personnel to respond"
"This hotel is underrated and if you are looking for a comfortable and spacious room, that’s reasonably priced, stay here. Tram service to Excalibur makes access to the south end of the strip easy. Food options are limited and some of the escalators were out of service during our stay but overall I was impressed with our accommodations."
Vegas trip was great. I had an exceptional experience.  Staff was friendly and rooms were nice. The elevators were a little run down but other than t that it was a good experience. With it being apart of mgm you can park anywhere
"We arrived with extreme motions sickness from all the traveling. On top of all the mayhem (being sick/keeping track of luggage) when checking in, we misplaced a piece of luggage and our room key. Francis #372608 found us in distress, found our luggage at security, talked to the front desk manager to find us a first floor room (we were originally on the 13th floor, but any motion, such as the elevator was not going to end well for us or the elevator). Sam at check-in found us a room on the first floor and continued to calm us, tell us everything would work out and basically, they saved our vacation. Because of both Francis and Sam on 12/9/22, we'll be staying at the Luxor EVERY time we come to Vegas. Thank you Francis and Sam!!"
"The Luxor is still and will always be that Oasis in the middle of the desert for us. Great people, providing great service, has always what we appreciate the most when staying here. In a time in where value for you dollar is important, the Luxor checks off every box and is a place I always recomend for folks wanting to visit Vegas."
"Rooms weren’t bad- food was over the top. Lots of hidden fees. Bartenders weren’t friendly. Opted out of getting my room cleaned and they did the first day and charged me anyways. It was a neat design and nice it was connected to the surrounding hotels. 

Buffet staff was very friendly."
"The Luxor financially gouges you at every turn...from the $35 daily resort fee to the $18 a day to park regardless of your status as a hotel guest. Why would they charge $18 a day to park, in addition to the $35 daily resort fee, only to make you walk a long distance from the parking structure to the hotel while exposed to the elements!?

Staff do not appear to be as pleasant as our previous stays over a year ago. Whether it was the registration desk or the cafe, everyone was abrupt and even abrasive in some cases. 

The only saving grace was the attentive and pleasant service provided by a gentleman named Richard in engineering when we experienced a problem with our air conditioning system.

Room was clean, shower head is not very flexible and a bit inconvenient, pillows seemed overfilled, bed was comfortable, good choice in tv programming options, West tower elevators are so much more efficient than other elevator system in hotel."
"Stayed in a king suite on the 4th floor.  The room was large with an extra tub (no jets) not far from the king size bed with many pillows.  The extra side room with a couch and chair and another TV allowed me to watch the World Cup without waking up my wife.  The location was perfect walking distance to Allegiant Stadium where I watched my OSU Beavers win the Las Vegas Bowl.
The room we had looked and smelled fine - the other room my college buddies had down the hall smelled moldy.  The price and location were above good.  Some staff were better than others but mostly all good.  December so no pool usage but looking at the expansive area with several pools from above - you can imagine this would be a good place in sunnier weather.
I will go back here in the future if their rates stay competitive."
"The room was quite outdated. Limited power options, no work environment in the room. There was a dirty rag on the floor when I walked in, and the TV console was covered in some sticky goop. The same sticky goo was all around the huge tub in the room which I avoided.  Poor water pressure and the TV reception was blurry"
"Stay was good, employees were friendly. My only complaint is that they do not have coffee makers in the rooms. That is standard for any hotel. This makes one have to walk downstairs just for coffee in the morning. Vending machine also did not function on my floor"
Old and just plain gross room! The only thing the shower was missing was uncapped used needles. The cigarette buts outside our room were there the whole time we were. $400+ a night and I felt like I was staying in a $49 room.
We booked a corner suite with a big tub for a couples weekend and didn’t even touch the tub. It was dirty and the windows near it were sketchy. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. Sheets are so scratchy and there’s no real comforter. There was food in the fridge when we arrived and we had to request the room be cleaned again. The sink leaked. The walls are so thin! The tint was peeling off the windows. Furniture was wonky and didn’t open right. The tv is old and the sound was off. The elevators looked and felt like they were falling apart. Not a great experience for the price! Worth it to pay a little more for a better hotel.
"I have been to VeGaS at least a dozen times, and have hopped around different casinos on the strip and on Fremont street. This has been BY FAR the best experience I have had.

I think my boyfriend and I were just really lucky with the staff we had. We arrived to check in and were told that we could upgrade to a suit for only $30 more. We were only there for one night and figured we take up the opportunity. The front desk woman AG gave us a $100 voucher to use at their Catina Mexican restaurant. The voucher was amazing and so thoughtful. It was just my boyfriend and I and the voucher said ""$25 per person"" but the restaurant in Luxor still let us max out the voucher! 

THEN the upgraded hotel room (which had a tub in it and a living room) had a small leak of water in the ceiling. They comped our entire stay! 

You will not find customer service like Luxor!"
"Tower rooms NICE pyramid rooms yuck!!! Staff nice, good location, nice casino! Next time only stay in tower NOT Pyramid or will stay somewhere else. All good service and fantasy show were really good. ;)"
"The Luxor is absolutely filthy and outdated.  The smoke residue and dust bunnies hanging from the cracked ceilings in the hallway, and the trash on top of the lower-level buildings if you look over the rail are disgusting. There are NO room amenities unless you pay extra. Not even a frig, I mean seriously even the cheapest Motel 6 has a frig.  The room was just kind of shabby and unkept. Hand prints and smudges on the bathroom door, Sink fixtures had the silver plating peeling off. Cracks in the walls.  The ""off season special price"" of $46.00 ended up costing well over $200 once they added, $30.00 for parking, multiple front desk fees for idk what. I am completely disappointed."
"The room was uncomfortable due to the fact the AC and vent fans (for tub area and in the bathroom) worked horribly. I will not spend 300$ a night for the King Corner Suite again. Not worth the price. I rather just stay in the tower which has nicer and working rooms.
The employees were very nice and hotel was clean."
"Walls seem to be a bit thin cuz I could hear the outside traffic and other neighbors in the room next door. 
No coffee makers in rooms. When you want to have a tea late night (when you need it, you can’t make yourself one and Starbucks is closed."
We had a blast in Vegas and we're more than happy with our room. Though hotel staff including drink servers seemed to be lacking greatly. We did not have any issues and enjoy our time immensely. Would def stay there again.
Someone has a master key and scans into peoples rooms and will steal half of your stuff so just be prepared. I didn’t realize how common this was for this specific hotel until after it happened to us.
"The overall smell is terrible. The entry way smells like someone's musky, flowering armpit. Found a peanut butter cup by the bed. The layout of the place is ridiculous. Even with the map. Outlets are loose and scary."
great stay. absolutely recommend. the hotel was in a great spot and had tons of things to do in the hotel alone. great food options as well. will absolutely be staying again on my next visit to Vegas.
"Didn't get placed in the room we reserved. Some staff were careless. The Luxor is beautiful to look at, but there are so many promotors trying to get you into a timeshare by providing discounted shows."
"The hotel is a fun place to stay. I enjoyed eating at the Buffet, if they have the Verde Posole I would recommend having a bowl or two. We enjoyed the Public House as well. One thing is the hotel is starting to look the 30 years old it is in some areas, carpet looks worn, the inclinators are a little rough and bumpy. I like the new security system that requires key cards to access floors on the elevator.  The rooms had been updated, but parts of the bathroom were already worn."
I do not recommend staying here unless you’re old and on a budget. It is far away from most events on the strip. The drains have issues. The elevator is at an angle so it feels horrible when you’re drunk. The food is mid. There’s no microwave or refrigerator in the hotel room.
Every service in this hotel sucked valet tried to give me wrong car front desk was so rude try to complain as soon as they found that would not answer my phone calls from room never fixed anything. . . ...
Great place to stay and affordable. Definitely will be back. Place was clean and staff was friendly. The check in process was effortless. The tv program could be updated with more channels since it currently has very basic channels.
"One of the bartenders was extremely rude. Asked me for an ID for a cup of water, then denied me a cup of water since “I have to buy something”. It’s a small thing, but who denies someone a cup of water. I wasn’t rude or anything, think the guy got mad because I drank 3 cups of water in 2 hours. That shouldn’t matter though. Didn’t know the Luxor was run by Nestle."
"We always wanted to stay here and made the decision too, and we did not regret it, very clean hotel, friendly staff, we had a seamless check-in, they set us up with our MGM rewards card, hotel is right on the strip at the South end, we enjoyed the easy access to Mandalay, and Excalibur hotel right from the Luxor, great stay!"
"The bars and atmospheres were great, check-in is a mess and getting ahold of the front desk was terrible. Sat on hold with the front desk for over 20 minutes to get our rooms situated. The hotel is great and bar staff was fun to talk with during our 4 night stay."
"Dated hotel trying to be a resort, but many things need to be fixed escalators, elevators, no fridge in the room, bathroom exhaust fan not working, window seals broken dripping condensation. The breakfast buffet was not open and they only have an outside pool so it was closed."
Horrible and not.                    Worth me coming back ever again even if the rooms free.                                                                           I would much rather pay 250 a night than to stay at a location this bad in my future trips to vegas.                            I will keep this in mind which will motivate me to never step foot in the Luxor again
The suite was HUGE and super clean. The hotel staff is nothing short of AMAZING! Miriam Gomez took care of us and our room during our stay and she always always always went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed! She also had a very addicting bubbly personality and was a true joy to be around. The shows and exhibits that the hotel offered were amazing as well. They also make it very easy to secure tickets to shows offered at other hotels as well. It was an all around extremely pleasant experience! Thank you!
The staff was awesome! Everyone was very helpful and lovely. Love the breakfast at pyramid cafe. We were in town for basketball at michelob arena. Very short walk and didn’t have to go outdoors. Only issue was with the elevators but it’s because they have upped the security measures.
"It was ok, but it’s very dated and we found the person on the front desk not very helpful!

We weren’t  aware of any of the facilities of the hotel, which he could have up sold to us.

The room was clean, but some things needed attention, the bathroom sink was blocked and slow to drain, the double electrical socket kept falling out of the wall (possible electrocution risk!), noisy air conditioning/heating.  

We will be back to Vegas, but not to the Luxor, but a better hotel…"
I enjoyed Luxor. The housekeeper came back later to clean room. Hotel in between two others so I didn't have to go out in the cold to play. The restaurant was good and the tables was cheap. Will visit again in spring.
The hotel itself is decent. The room was clean and beds comfortable. I removed stars for how thin the walls are so you can hear everything from the rooms around. The wifi kept disconnecting too. If you’re looking for something decent at a good price it’s a good one though.
"The person on the phone and when I got to the rewards desk need to get on the same page. Besides paying for things I shouldn’t have had to because I should have gotten a different rewards package, it was an OK stay"
"Staying at a Luxor pyramid-suite was once a go-to regarding Las Vegas, but my room stunk to High-Heaven, and management seemed to not care... my only response is to not give a damn myself, and stay somewhere else on my next visit."
"The room was very nice, I wish there had been a mini fridge and microwave, however the tv was great and we brought a fire stick which was able to connect to the free wifi. The staff was super sweet, and there was a lot to do. Our room smelled smoke free, though we did hear our neighbors late at night, they weren't even yelling but the walls are not the thickest"
Long check in and check out. Prices have become outrageous. If you’re considering a family trip be prepared to pay for everything a-la-cart—-especially coffee and water. The food is good. The beds are comfortable.
"It was ok.  If you are going to a conference at the convention center, this is not a good location for you.  It is a mile+ to the monorail station at MGM grand.  It is a nice spot if this is the area that you will be in (MGM, NYNY, Mandalay, etc).  I liked the room, it was the basic one, but the elevators were slow, and there was not a lot of them.  Long waits at the elevator.  The housekeeping service was fantastic.  The staff was nice, and the restaurants were fine.  That said, it is an older hotel, and it was just ok.."
Visited Las Vegas for a College basket tournament at Mandalay Bay Michelin Arena. Stayed at Luxor. Great properties and did not have to go outside or take transportation to get to arena. Fun restaurants and sports bars along the way. Would stay here again.
I chose the Luxor after trying to stay at the NYNY. NYNY was very expensive.  The Luxor was almost half the price. I expected the quality to be about half but I was wrong. Great quality and great experience.
There is no refrigerator in room location is good. Casino no good pay off. No drinking water in room. Expensive super market just 1liter water $5:35 I was not happy at all hotel rate cheaper in weekdays
"We stayed 4 nights, and every day there was trash and bags of used linens/towels in the hallways.  There was also what looked like part of a rat trap.  The a/c in our room set itself to 79 while we were attending a show.  Front desk said it did that because of the outside temperature.  We set it back to 69 so we could sleep, but after a while it reset itself to 79!  We set it to 69 again and this time it stayed the rest of the night.  At checkout we tried to use their mobile app, but it failed every time we tried it."
Cleaning staff needs to be more on their job.the rooms are pricey which I don't mine when I get a clean room ..the hallway to our room was never mopped and when calling the front desk there was no answer
"Older casino. Need to search for outlets in room. 20-30 minute wait for an elevator, day and night. 2 out of 4 elevators were out of service the whole time, a portion of visit 3 were down. 
Small high limit area with with limited offerings.
Smoking was deadly at certain times. 
Mohegan, Foxwoods, and MGM Springfield all went smokeless and they didn’t lose a dime."
"Overall the property was poorly maintain with visible scuff marks on walls, dents on elevators and cleanliness. There was trash on the center of the buildings, I can see dust build-up throughout the casino.
The security guard that handled a combative female was professional and thanks for keeping the patrons safe."
"Having spoken highly of this casino/resort for years, this return for a birthday to our first location to stay in LV early in our relationship was met by disappointing process impacts (gave away a suite upon which we had placed deposit months prior), hotel deterioration (peeling wallpaper, water dripping from ceiling in 2nd room to which we were moved, broken bathroom exhaust fan, peeling wallpaper, dislodged tiles, body hair in soaking tub), surprisingly poor buffet food quality, unnecessarily elevator lines.  Great exhibits, shows, friendly housekeeping staff, and general staff engagements otherwise."
If the elevator wasn't broken it might've been better. There was at least a 45 min delay in getting an empty elevator. 2 of the 16 elevators were broken that I know of. They just happened to be where our room was.
"Why do you expect more with a $47 room?
I read all the previous reviews from Dec. it is so interesting to read about the complaints. Let’s face it… why do you expect a Wynn or the Bellagio when you paid under $100? 
Yes, you have to walk (you have to walk a lot everywhere in Vegas), you have to rent a fridge, the elevator feels like it may just fall right there (potential lawsuit?)… but you paid $47 on Groupon! 
Every hotel in Vegas will have fees from $30-50 and they are upfront about this. 
I was able to get two rooms connecting together in Vegas dirt cheap, but the rooms are nice and clean. I also got to show my kid a pyramid hotel!The staff is working hard and well. Yes we got to our room and one AC unit was not working… within 30 minutes it was fix by a technician and a fridge was brought to us. 
I am a luxury girl, but with times like these…. $47 on Groupon! How can I pass that up when I need space and 3 beds? Of course next on our agenda for an anniversary in the far future is the Bellagio or Wynn for $2000-700 a night… 
Honestly my foreign relatives were very impressed by the hotel and room. 
Elevator…. Oooohhhhh, close your eyes and keep going. We are saving money right?!"
"I didn’t know I had to double check if a hotel size of Luxor had room service but they don’t. The shower drain was clogged, no mini fridge (at an extra cost, and while gambling in the casino all of the bars were closed or didn’t open in time. I would‘t stay here again for free nights."
"Our friends room got robbed and everything was taken including the underwear and the other  friend found a stranger in her room after she got out from a shower. Everything the same day.We used to love the hotel, we are not staying there any more.
,we are not feeling safe."
I couldn’t believe this trip went the way it did it from check in to the room and the internet disconnecting I seen a show and dirt on the ventilation systems to the long walks with the elevators not working just overall a bad existence wouldn’t recommend
"Everything was nice, from the check in to the rooms to the maid service to MGM rewards staff to the casino. Good location and good entertainment. Great value. We saw BlueMan group and were really entertained. Will definitely stay again."
"Terrible customer service. Paid for a king and got 2 queens. Overpaid by $200 even though it was supposed to be $400 for pickleball players. Front desk was so mean. Charged my partner $648,000 for a room. Yes you read that correct. A joke of a hotel."
Excellent venue and proximity to stadium is a short walk. Will recommend the Luxor to anyone traveling to Las Vegas for a Raider game or any other event at Allegiant Stadium. MGM app is easy to use and eliminates all waits. Buy the self parking pass for extra ease!
Charging cord for Apple Watch went missing from room! Miscommunication with having to checking out and checking in again for second night. Never heard of this!  Missed part of football game to run back to hotel!!
"Upon check in, our room was very dark and outdated.  It looked NOTHING like the pictures online.  Also, our bathroom was covered in hair and didn't look clean.  We will choose a different hotel in the future."
"Parking structure to front desk reservations and rooms is very very long. Not recommended for people with asthma, bad knees, or elderly. Valet and parking is expensive. East tower rooms are the best. Friendly and helpful staff."
Stay at Luxor was ok but the post stay credit card charges 111.12 is totally unacceptable. I will be disputing such charges with my credit card company. We paid for an upgrade then wasn't in the room 12 hours before we had a major ceiling water leak in the bathroom and had to move .
"Decent hotel. Our AC didn't work, and we spent so much money ubering down to the fun part of the strip that the cheaper rate the Luxor tends to offer, was not really worth it. The hotel desperately needs to be updated, and the elevators are seriously sketchy. They wobble and shake, and are slanted. Each trip up and down was uncomfortable. Our AC also would not stay on. So woke up multiple times a night with the room at 79 degrees, instead of at 68 where we set it. And would have to turn it back on again. Just to wake up in sweat 2 hours later."
"Other than it’s location at the south end of the strip, our stay at the Luxor was perfect for a budget friendly 4 day stay…Staff all friendly, hotel clean, room clean ( pyramid) slight issue at check in as our room was not ready until around 7 pm… Front desk took meal off our bill which was a surprise and much appreciated… Thank-you Mari… 
Quiet hotel at this time of year, overall quiet everywhere, it was nice… 
We liked this property and glad we stayed… it is a bit too south down the strip for our liking but glad to have enjoyed it at least once…"
"Not a premium property. Some outdated technology (e.g. no USB outlets). The room TV seemed quite good, but with a terrible signal fom the service provider and a low quality remote. You also pay almost $40 a night resort fee that gives nothing except internet service, but that will not let you access many ticket agencies (you get flagged as potential fraud...but the it works fine when you use your phone's own signal). Avoid."
Rooms appeared dirty and outdated. A lot of areas in the room that appeared damaged and looked as if everything was fixed with a quick repair rather than addressing the problem or replacing the damaged item. A lot areas were dirty.
Room was not up to par for the $787 I was charged. Showers that don't have a door caused a slip hazard for me cause water got out to the tile. Beds were not that comfortable. Not worth the almost $800
"After checking our bags at the bell service because our check in wasn’t ready (even though I paid for early check in) the baggage ticket we had was stolen, by the time we noticed it was gone the thief had gone to the bell service and claimed our luggage without any form of identification, causing us to lose everything we brought. The hotel did next to nothing to make up for it considering the severity."
"Checked in to my room only to discover that it had not been vacuumed when housekeeping turned the room over from the last guest. There were several toenail clippings on the carpet. I tried to call Housekeeping only to discover that the phone in the room was inoperable. On the second day of the stay, the housekeeper changed out the towels but did not make the bed. When I went to use the towels, a long black hair was on the towel; I do not have long black hair."
"Our hallway on the 6th floor had a large two wall water leak outside our room. The drywall was exposed down to the pipes with what looked like mold. You could tell by the extent of the damage this had been there for a while. We walked thru wet carpet to get to our room. Luxor has differed maintained, it’s like a cheap off strip hotel."
"This is a great Hotel and Casino......DEFINITELY WILL RECOMMEND!!
You will like th?e fact that you read this   review. and took my advice From Pricing,  Service  and location.....You cannot ask for a better  Hotel  and Casino.  ......THE LUXOR  ROCKS!!!!"
I've stayed multiple times with no issues except the last one. There was an issue with the air conditioner that no one came to fix after multiple calls. Everything else was good and satisfactory. I will stay here again in the future
"The room was very dirty. If you looked at the carpet, it had not been vacumed at the edges...you could see piles of dust and dirt. Water pressure on the upper floors was low. TV channels did not work,"
"Uncomfortable beds, toilet seats that wouldn’t stay up, no coffee machine in the room, the TV didn’t work, and no refrigerator in the room. A refrigerator could be provided for $35 a day.  Someone please tell me what I’m paying for…. Oh, and this was an upgraded room. SMH!"
Dated rooms and facilities. Elevators clunky and light didn’t work. Resort credit through MGM awards not issued.  ATMs often broken. Good food in the Pyramid Cafe with excellent wait staff. Drinks were cold.
"Rooms decor, sound control, temp control were outdated as well as keys failed multiple times. The one issue that had to be addressed was resolved quickly and nicely by staff. Overall, not the nicest stay. Clearly better options for location and quality of hotel. If you don’t spend time in room or care about fun/vibes of the casino floor, or location of the rest of the strip then not a bad place. 25-45 dollar Uber rides to get to anything else can be a problem for some."
very clean and fast service. They were able to accommodate us when we booked on such short notice. Housekeeping was also very friendly and quick to service you. The casino was very clean and constantly being disinfected.
"Rooms were clean but one major thing that was upsetting to us was there was no fridge or bottled water. You have to walk to the vending and pay $3 for one bottle. I think that it should be a minimum of 2 bottles a day. People need water and you should not have to pay for it. Next thing, the house keeping cut us off multiple times walkin in the hall way and glared at us. They were also having very loud conversations in the hall way. I think that they should be more respectful of the people paying for the rooms. Sleep was hard, you can hear everything in the rooms around you. Sheets were scratchy. Luxor was also very expensive, food, water, not very many budget friendly places to eat.  When they take all your money in slots they should at least have cheaper food. Also, do not buy beers at the bar.... 2 beers (small) were $20.. We will not stay there again, you can have a way better experience off the strip."
"First time staying at the Luxor, I would rate it average . I will probably not stay here again, the breakfast Buffet was total GARBAGE , old slices of pizza, country gravy was very runny, only breakfast meat was sausage links. I m pretty sure the sausage links weren't even 100 meat, they were dry and over cooked' We did eat breakfast the next morning at the Cafe were your breakfast was made to order....that was a good breakfast."
"Luxor gets bad reviews that are unnecessary in my opinion. We had an Elite Tower King Room. Room number 6312. Very clean room. Bathroom was spotless. Shower was excellent. The view was of the airport, Tropicana, MGM Grand and Excalibur. We’ve stayed in the tower rooms five years ago in 2017. They are as nice now as they were when they were first renovated."
Hotel was in an inconvenient location. Amenities in room were worn down or didn’t work. AC units would randomly turn off and make the room stuffy. Staff unpleasant to deal with. Hotel was difficult to navigate through. Good and drinks are overpriced and not good. Too few card playing tables
"Our trip started by going to self parking and seeing a daily fee. I had requested to be close to self parking but was put on the entire other side. Got my key on my phone to avoid waiting in line for check in but it didn’t work. After carrying all of our luggage across the entire casino. Then had to wait in line to get a key. Asked about the self parking and was not told to put it on the key. Got to the room that had a pounding sound in the bathroom. Called the front desk and it took them 45 minutes to get there. This is now 2;30 am, 5:30 am to our bodies. Found no refrigerator, microwave or coffee maker. Wasted a gallon of milk. Had to spend $15 a day at Starbucks…… which on the third day was so understaffed that I waited an hour for my mobile order which was not even what I wanted because they were out of everything!!! Then I see I’m paying $39 per day resort fee….. for what??? We never had our room cleaned the entire time we were there. Had to call for toilet paper by Tuesday."
"I was impressed by the discount I received from MGM rewards and enjoyed my brunch at the buffet .The casino has great deals of new machine and entertainment was spectacular. Surely recommend this place to friends, family"
The room was much bigger than expected! It was clean and had everything we needed. Except a refridgerator but that wasn’t an issue for us. It’s close to everything downtown! We would definitely stay here again.
"Room was clean but very spartan.  No coffee maker, no microwave, no frig. Very long winding hallways to get to the rooms.  No easy check-in.  Overall, not a user-friendly place to stay. Would not recommend it unless you have no need for the things listed above and are planning to remain in the hotel for the entire visit."
"We always stay at Bellagio or NYNY, but wanted to try something different, we upgraded to the premium tub suite, and had issues with the room, couldn’t use the tub, as the water was warm not hot, same as shower, the living room was less than to be desired, broken down couch, and just a bunch of random tables in there, no TV and was very odd. The staff was great, food was good, but really disappointed in the room."
Though there wasa minor issue with the room that my husband and I stayed but the staff made sure to address the issue.  I will come back to stay here again.  Staff are very accommodating and approachable
"I paid for the early check-in option online (11AM) for the hotel, as I was flying in from Hawaii on the red-eye, and would have liked to simply jump into the shower and plop on my bed and get some sleep. Even though my payment went through, the system did not process it, or something like that, so I stood in the front desk line, which was about 50 people deep. Fortunately a lady, probably one of the managers, saw me and asked if I needed any help. I explained the situation to her, and she pulled me out of the line, and promptly offered me a room that was ready. By time I got to the room, it was nearly 1PM. I was too tired to think of asking for anything at the time, and I was not offered anything in compensation for having the problem. The hotel itself was ok. Needed to get used to the elevators, as the do not travel straight up and down, so the rattle quite a bit. The carpeting shows the hotel has not been through any recent renovations."
"We love staying at the Luxor, it is a great value with an excellent location. Our only disappointment is they have taken the refrigerators out of the rooms making it more difficult to keep leftovers and drinks cold. We like the smaller casinos, and the Luxor is great for a less overwhelming stay!"
The Luxor has great events and exhibits but the quality of the rooms worse than a motel 6. The next time we come to Vegas and we do come often we will not stay there again. The rooms and hallway hallways are dirty and terribly run down. The property needs to be either remodeled or torn down
"A bit pricier than 5 years ago overall but I’ll be back and the Luxor is a solid place to stay.  Hot water is not in short supply.  Really nothing that was lacking.  Super Happy Overall, had a fantastic comfortable time at the Luxor!"
Family time weekend! Clean rooms. Excellent food. Lost money but had a great time doing it! Staff very accommodating. Always willing to help in any way they can. My family’s go to hotel when visiting Vegas.
Was able to get a last min room after we decided to stay one more night at the NFR.  Every thing was amazing and the front desk was able to get a room for us on the same floor as our friends staying there.  My only complaint is I could not get a hold of anyone in room service for a coffee delivery and they do not have coffee pots in the room.  I sat on the phone for 45 min being transferred and sitting on hold before the call got disconnected. The husband finally went to the coffee shop to get it for me.  Who stays up all night having fun and doesn't want coffee first before peopling?
I always love staying here.  Reasonably prices clean rooms and nice staff. Would love to stay in an upgraded room when I come back. Looking to bring my kids here in June I would love to get good comp rooms
For the money the place is safe and clean & quiet once you’re inside your room. Easy access doors to Uber area. Quick ride to the airport. I love that you can skip the check in (long) lines are use the MGM digital app to check in and walk straight to your room when you arrive.
Eat at Tender - great service and food.  Visit Ari at the Aurora bar - great customer service.  Location is great.  Value is great.  Rooms are very nice but have no coffee makers or fridge and room service was mostly “unavailable” when we tried to order.
"Staff did care about any issues. The few that did, could not help cause they needed to talk to a supervisor. Weed smoke, broken elevators and no hotel security when called. Even asking for a new remote was not granted"
"Hannah at check-in is efficient and kind. This property is older but still in good shape. Connected to Mandalay Bay & Excalibur & MGM & New York New York properties are easy walks so in heart of great entertainment, restaurant & bar area."
"I stayed at Luxor with my friends for a conference. The staff at the hotel was nice as well as the cleaning service. If you are into casinos and shows, it is a very walkable area. The only downside was that there was indoor smoking allowed which made the lobby level of the hotel smell terrible and was also suffocating. In addition, it was always extremely cold in the hotel and the lights seemed like they were half on which gave me a headache every day."
The Luxor was my go to place. This last trip was a massive disappointment. Avoid the buffet! Nasty and expensive. Worse thing… no bacon at brunch. Very few table games open. Either no more lace to sit or wait for hours before someone gets up.
"I had a high anticipation of the Luxor heading in for my first trip to Vegas. Granted the resort is 25 years old, BUT the neglect was apparent. If you’re choosing to stay in the pyramid expect poor lighting when getting ready, and also the linens and pillows are all worn out. The minimum bet for poker tables was $20 which seemed a little high for the level of casino it is. But the service is pretty good and app is helpful. I recommend the MGM Grand or The Mirage over the Luxor"
"...and now it's not. CarrotTop is the headliner - which should tell you all you need to know. It's like meeting the hot girl from high school who is now a hooker with a booze issue. 

I stayed here twice in two weeks. Once by choice (for a game) and once because I was way too late on making a reservation at Mandalay.

If you're paying more than $49/night, you're paying WAY too much. I also made the mistake of getting a cabana at the pool. The couch looked like a baby may have been born on it.

This hotel NEEDS renovation. No USB ports in the room.

One good thing - the table stakes are generally low. Although when it sells out (usually because Mandalay is full when there's a conference) they raise the stakes...which is just ridiculous.

If you told me that I would never be able to stay at the Luxor again, I would say ""thank you thank you thank you!!"""
"Terrible, dirty hotel. Staff will not help you at all. The check in process was a hassle. The carpets all around the hotels are dirty. The food was overpriced for the quality. Overall not at all satisfied with my stay"
Stayed at the Luxor during the National Finals Rodeo. The hotel and casino were great energy and a great time. Lots of folks but the hotel handled everything perfectly in checking in and checking out. This was a really good Vegas experience. I will stay there again!
"Lot’s of rude casino servers and dealer’s. Room’s didn’t feel very nice, for a place that bills itself as a fancy Las Vegas hotel. Also you have to rent a fridge for $25 a night. 

Although pricey in general, not as expensive as I thought. Excellent food at the pyramid cafe and the backstage deli. Pyramid cafe is extremely understaffed on the weekends. Cool shopping malls on the way to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Overall, I’m going back next year."
"First time staying here; however have gambled prior. Booked four nights comp with no RF plus FP & RC. Booked a tower one bedroom suite. Got put in a corner pyramid suite; from what I can tell about 100 sq ft difference. Room 5121 to be exact. It’s not cramped, but bad use of space. The fact that it’s in the pyramid makes the room set up weird. Soaker tub,no jets. Nice size mini fridge. No coffee maker. Bed was not comfortable- I’m thinking older mattress. Bathroom has a standard shower, one vanity. Chaise sofa & TV in the sitting area. Desk with lamp. 

The room was clean. The casino is clean. Most staff are friendly. Food court on upper level. Starbucks x3. Easy access to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay via indoor walk ways. Tram access which I have never used. Drink service, for the most part was good. 

Now on to petty commentary. 

Elevator bank for my room was 4A. Down a hall, around a corner. In a corner. No foot traffic near by. A lot could go wrong. Not a fan. Most elevators are in public places. 

Cell service was abysmal. I usually never use Wi-Fi; had to here. Didn’t matter if I was in my room or on the casino floor. I honestly can’t remember the last time I had to use hotel Wi-Fi. This was the only casino I had the issue. 

Poor lighting in hotel room. Difficult for makeup application. Poor lighting in sitting area. Reading would be difficult. 

The soaker tub is in the corner with the slanted wall. A 5yo could easily get in the tub. Full size adult? Don’t hurt yourself. 

The hallway of my floor, and I would guess the entire pyramid need some love. Definitely time for a refurb. Run down? No. Falling apart? No. Just need some fresh paint and new carpet. 

No deadbolt on door or separate door jamb or separate lock. To lock the door the handle needs to be turned up. Not a fan. 

On the brighter side

Three Starbucks. MGM has 100% mobile check in with digital key. The backstage deli is a hidden gem. Food is actually very good and fresh. During pool season the Luxor has Temptation Sundays- LGBTQ ️‍ friendly. 

In the end, this is a clean value property. Would I stay here again? Yes. Would it be my first choice? No. I would recommend if budget conscious. If you do not have a car but have mobility issues it may not be a good choice. The resort is large and very south strip. If you don’t mind walking and like to get your steps in, this would be a good place."
